PLANETSIDE(tm) USER AGREEMENT AND SOFTWARE LICENSE

THIS AGREEMENT DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON WHICH SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT INC. OR, FOR SUBSCRIBERS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ONLY, SOE EUROPE LIMITED (COLLECTIVELY, "SOE" OR "WE") OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO AN ACCOUNT (THE "ACCOUNT") TO PLAY THE PLANETSIDE MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE COMBAT GAME FOR THE PC AND/OR ANY EXPANSION PACKS OR EXTENSIONS (INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY, THE "GAME"). BY PRESSING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BELOW. BY PRESSING THE "I DO NOT ACCEPT" BUTTON, YOU DECLINE OUR OFFER, IN WHICH CASE YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE REGARDING ITS RETURN POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE PLANETSIDE PRODUCT. 

1. Accounts are available only to adults or, in their discretion, their minor child of at least thirteen years of age (for the purposes of this Agreement, a "minor child" is a person of at least thirteen years of age who has not reached the age of majority under the law of the jurisdiction in which he or she resides).  If you are a minor child, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must complete the registration process, in which case they will take full responsibility for all obligations under this Agreement.  By clicking the "I Accept" button and providing us with a credit card number or, if made available by SOE, a valid GameCard (or other payment option which SOE chooses to make available to you), you represent that you are an adult and are accepting this Agreement either on behalf of yourself or your minor child.  You may not transfer or share your Account with anyone, except that if you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one minor child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account). You are liable for all activities conducted through the Account, and parents or guardians are liable for the activities of their minor child.  Corporations and other entities are not eligible to procure Accounts.

2. To play the Game, you must (a) purchase or receive through an SOE-authorized promotional offer (such as an authentic disk bundled with a game magazine) the PlanetSide CD-ROM for the PC (the "CD-ROM"), or applicable files which we may make available for direct download, which includes software required for the Game (the "Software"), (b) have a fully paid Account, and (c) have an Internet connection (which we do not provide) to access your Account. In addition to any fees described herein, you are responsible for paying all applicable taxes (including those we are not required to collect) and for all hardware, software, service and other costs you incur to access your Account.  Neither this Agreement nor your Account entitles you to any subsequent releases of the Software, or to any expansion packs, extensions, or similar ancillary products, without paying applicable charges. You understand that we may update or otherwise enhance the Software at any time and in doing so incur no obligation to furnish such updates to you pursuant to this Agreement.

3. We may amend this Agreement at any time in our sole discretion. Amendments shall be communicated to you at the time you log into your Account. Such amendments shall be effective whenever you agree to the amendments by accessing your Account or playing the Game after we make the notification available for your review.

4. Upon registration, you must select a password. You may not disclose your password to any third party. We never ask you for your password by telephone or email, and you should not disclose it this way if someone asks you to do so.  Although we may offer a feature that allows you to "save" or "remember" your password on your hard drive, please note that by using this feature third parties may be able to access your computer and thus your Account.

5. We describe our fees and billing procedures at a hotlink located at www.planetside.com – those fees and billing procedures are incorporated by reference.  All fees for subscribers within the European Union are stated in Euros; all fees for subscribers located outside the European Union are stated in U.S. Dollars – all unless otherwise specified at the hotlink referenced above.  All fees are prepaid and non-refundable. Upon your acceptance of these terms, we have the right to automatically charge your credit card the Account fee plus any applicable taxes we are required to collect, and you authorize us to do so. Thereafter, each time your Account comes up for renewal, we have the right to charge your credit card the then-current renewal rate plus any applicable taxes we are required to collect, and you authorize us to do so. If we are unable to process your credit card at a renewal period, your Account may be immediately terminated. If we make a Game Card available and you use a Game Card to pay for your Account, the Game Card shall activate your Account for the period stated on the Game Card and, thereafter, you will either need to provide a valid credit card (in which case your credit card will subsequently be charged as referenced above) or purchase another Game Card for subsequent subscription periods, or your Account will be closed.  You may terminate your Account at any time through the Account registration process.  If you terminate your Account during your initial free period, if any, your account will be closed at the end of the free period and you will not be billed.  If you terminate your Account during any subscription cycle, your Account will be closed at the end of the then-current cycle and you will not be billed again unless you affirmatively reopen the Account.  We do not give full or partial refunds for subscription periods that you have purchased.

6. We may terminate this Agreement (including your Software license and your Account) and/or suspend your Account immediately and without notice if you breach this Agreement; infringe any intellectual property rights; if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; upon gameplay, chat or any player or account activity whatsoever which we, in our sole discretion, determine is inappropriate and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game as set forth in the Game player rules of conduct, which are posted at a hotlink located at www.planetside.com; or upon a violation of the Station Terms of Service. If we terminate this Agreement or suspend your Account under these circumstances, you will lose access to your Account for the duration of the suspension and/or the balance of any prepaid period without any refund.  We may also terminate this Agreement if we decide, in our sole discretion, to discontinue offering the Game, in which case we may provide you with a prorated refund of any prepaid amounts.

7. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we hereby grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software solely in connection with playing the Game via an authorized and fully-paid Account.  You may not copy (except to make one necessary back-up copy), distribute, sell, auction, rent, lease, loan, modify or create derivative works, adapt, translate, transmit, perform, display, transmit, sublicense or transfer all or any portion of the Software. You may not copy any of the written materials accompanying the Software.  You may not loan the Software unless we expressly permit you to do so in writing, and only then in accordance with the terms in that express permission (for instance, in conjunction with an SOE authorized "buddy key" program).  You may not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Software except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. The Software may contain license management software that restricts your use of the Software.

8. We and our suppliers shall retain all rights, title and interest, including, without limitation, ownership of all intellectual property rights relating to or residing in the CD-ROM, the Software and the Game, all copies thereof, and all game character data in connection therewith. You acknowledge and agree that you have not and will not acquire or obtain any intellectual property or other rights, including any so called "moral rights" or right of exploitation, of any kind in or to the CD-ROM, the Software or the Game, including, without limitation, in any character(s), item(s), coin(s) or other material or property, and that all intellectual property rights and rights of exploitation in such character(s), item(s), coin(s) or other material or property are exclusively owned by us.

9. You may not use any unauthorized third party software, code, program, script or device to modify the Software to change Game play. You may not create, facilitate, host, link to or provide any other means through which the Game may be played by others, such as through server emulators. You may not take any action which imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure. You may not buy, sell or auction (or host or facilitate the ability to allow others to buy, sell or auction) any Game characters, items, monetary units (such as coin, if any), or copyrighted material.

10. To obtain an Account, you will be required to choose both a login name and a player name. While you are encouraged to use a pseudonym, especially if you are a minor child, you may not pick a name that violates anyone's trademarks, publicity rights or other proprietary rights.

11. As part of your Account, you can upload content to our servers in various forms, such as in the selections you make for the Game and in chat rooms and similar user-to-user areas (collectively, your "Content"). In addition to any restrictions we may set forth in the Rules of Conduct for the Game and in the Station Terms of Service, your Content shall not: (a) infringe any third party intellectual property, other proprietary or publicity/privacy rights; (b) violate any law or regulation; (c) be defamatory, profane, offensive, obscene, child pornographic or harmful to minors; or (d) contain any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information. We may take any action with respect to your Content if we believe it may create liability for us or may cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers. You hereby grant to us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise all intellectual property rights, in any media now known or not currently known, associated with your Content.  Additionally, the Game may include certain optional voice communication features that you may choose to use.  If you use these voice communication features, if any, to send or receive voice messages through the Game, you agree that (a) you will not receive or send any Content in violation of this Agreement, (b) we are not responsible for any Content transmitted by you, other users, or any other third parties, and (c) we are not responsible for any use of such features by any other users or third parties, including without limitation, uses that may result in unauthorized access or damage to your computer and/or the information stored there.   

12. We can be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  Additionally, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries. Furthermore, if you request any technical support, you consent to our remote accessing and review of the computer you load the Software onto for purposes of support and debugging. You agree that we may communicate with you via email and any similar technology for any purpose relating to the Game, the Software and any services or software which may in the future be provided by us or on our behalf. You may choose to visit www.planetside.com or www.station.sony.com, the web site of Sony Online Entertainment Inc. ("The Station") if such web sites offer services such as a PlanetSide game themed chat room or other services of interest to you.  You are subject to the terms and conditions, rules of play and privacy policies of Sony Online Entertainment Inc. while on such web sites and/or in connection with use of your Account and the Game, which terms and conditions, rules of play and policy are incorporated herein by this reference.  We have not approved or checked any third party sites linked to The Station and we are not responsible or liable in any way for their content. Your use of such third party sites will be subject to the terms and conditions of those sites. Since we do not control other web sites and/or privacy policies of third parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to others.  Solely for the purpose of patching and updating the Game, you hereby grant us permission to (i) upload Game file information from the Game directory and (ii) download Game files to you. You acknowledge that any and all character data is stored and is resident on our servers, and any and all communications that you make within the Game (including, but not limited to, messages solely directed at another player or group of players) traverse through our servers, may or may not be monitored by our personnel, you have no expectation of privacy in any such communications and you expressly consent to monitoring of communications that you send and receive.

For persons in European Union countries, terms such as "personal information" refer to "personal data" as defined by the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the "Directive").  We will not collect any personal data from you unless you provide it voluntarily by providing us with your freely given specific and informed consent.  You acknowledge and agree that we may transfer such information (including, without limitation, your personally identifiable information and personal data) to the United States or other countries or may share such information with our licensees and agents in connection with the Game; you should be aware that different data protection regulations may apply.  

13.  WE PROVIDE THE CD-ROM, THE SOFTWARE, THE ACCOUNT, THE GAME AND ALL OTHER SERVICES "AS IS."  WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not ensure continuous, error-free, secure or virus-free operation of the CD-ROM, the Software, the Game, your Account or continued operation or availability of any given server. Some states do not allow limitations as to how long an implied warranty lasts and/or exclusions or limitations of consequential damages, so the above limitations and/or exclusions of liability may not apply to you.  This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights which vary from state to state.

We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from any causes beyond our reasonable control. Further, we cannot and do not promise or ensure that you will be able to access your Account whenever you want, and there may be extended periods of time when you cannot access your Account.

14. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, OUR PARENT, OUR AFFILIATES OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE POSSESSION, USE, OR MALFUNCTION OF THE SOFTWARE, YOUR ACCOUNT, THE GAME, OR THIS AGREEMENT. OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IS LIMITED TO $100. Some states do not allow the foregoing limitations of liability, so they may not apply to you.

15. You shall comply with all applicable laws regarding your use of the the Software, your access to your Account and your playing of the Game. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not download, use or otherwise export or re-export the Software except in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the laws of the United States.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights hereunder, and any attempt to the contrary is void. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided herein, this Agreement may not be amended except in a writing signed by both parties.
