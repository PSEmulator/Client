@IAInstantActionToolTip=Select this button to transfer to a randomly selected hotspot.
@InstantActionSanctuaryDescription=This option takes you to your Empire's Sanctuary. Your Sanctuary is a safe haven where no combat is likely to occur. It houses the training facilities which allow you to spend more time with various weapons and vehicles, and also houses the Shuttle buildings which give you access to orbital drop pods.\n\nThe Sanctuary is the center of your Empire and your haven from harm. It's also a often-used staging ground from which to launch coordinated assaults.
@InstantActionHotSpotDescription=This option takes you to one of the many Hot Spots in the world so you can plunge immediately into action.\n\nA Hot Spot is anywhere where a sufficient quantity of your own Empire's troops are exchanging fire with enemy troops. This generally assures you of entering a good sized battle when choosing this option.\n\nWARNING! If you choose this option, you will be entering a live fire area and you will encounter hostiles.\n\nDon't worry though, if you need to leave, you can return to your Sanctuary by choosing the 'Return to Sanctuary' option in your ESCAPE menu.
@InstantActionDefaultDescription=Choose one of the two options on the left to determine where your new character appears within the world of Auraxis.\n\nPlace your cursor over one of the two buttons to get more information about that option.
@InstantActionNotInVehicle=You can't use instant action while in a vehicle.

@Empire2=NEW CONGLOMERATE
@Empire3=VANU SOVEREIGNTY

@E1=TERRAN REPUBLIC
@E2=NEW CONGLOMERATE
@E3=VANU SOVEREIGNTY

@Empire0Description=In existence for over a thousand years, the Terran Republic was the sole governing power with an intergalactic reign. Largely militant in its rule, the Terran Republic nonetheless maintained absolute authority until recently when an expeditionary force was sent into a wormhole to colonize a newly discovered world named Auraxis.\n\nDuring the course of colonizing Auraxis, three Main Bases were established at different locations on the planet's surface to expedite the colonization. In the following years numerous outposts were constructed across Auraxis' continents.\n\nRemnants of an ancient alien race were also unearthed, and this race became known as the Vanu. No traces of what happened to the Vanu could ever be found, but elements of their technology were discovered during the colonization stages, most notably ‘rebirthing' technology. Utilizing a hybrid of man-made and Vanu technology, humans were able to store their genetic pattern. Whenever someone died, the person would be able to come back to life via the rebirthing technology.\n\nNear the end of the colonization period, the wormhole collapsed, stranding the Terran Republic expedition from the main Empire. Tensions grew and escalated. Emboldened now that the main body of the Empire was cut off, the Terran Republic was ultimately divided into three Empires: those still allied with Terran Republic, and two new empires - the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nNow the three Empires are engaged in a world-wide war for control of Auraxis. A war without permanent death.
@Empire1Description=The Terran Republic's focus is to re-establish its authority as a single governing body. While the Terran Republic is actively engaged in an official state of war against those that seceded into the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty, the goal is to reunite everyone under the Terran Republic once again.\n\nThe traditionalists that comprise the Terran Empire are both embarrassed and outraged by the secessions, and strive to regain control as quickly as possible. This is partially to re-establish a single order, but also in fear of the wormhole re-opening and facing punitive measures for allowing the secessions to happen in the first place.\n\nTerran Republic equipment relies largely on speed, with an emphasis on fast-firing weaponry. Their weaponry lacks the punching power on an individual shot basis in comparison to the New Conglomerate, but they make up for it with an extremely fast refire rate. Likewise for their vehicles, which rely on delivering as many projectiles within a short timeframe as possible.
@Empire2Description=The New Conglomerate was formed by soldiers that felt the Terran Republic was too militant, and in many ways ancient, in its governing practices. While many felt oppressed, the sheer size and scope of the Terran Republic Empire was a definitive silencing factor. Subsequently when the wormhole collapsed, it wasn't long before a number of soldiers began openly questioning and criticizing the Terran Republic ways. And in short order a violent revolution occurred in which the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty formed.\n\nSeeking to distance themselves as much as possible from the Terran Republic's traditional government, the New Conglomerate seeks a freer society. In doing so the New Conglomerate soldiers combat the Terran Republic to defend against becoming re-acquired, and fight the Vanu Sovereignty who are trying to monopolize the planet's alien technology.\n\nThe New Conglomerate focus on hitting as hard as possible. Many of their weapons deliver the most damage on a per shot basis, but lack the refiring rate of the Terran Republic. Likewise their vehicles are extremely powerful, but don't possess the agile handling of the Vanu Sovereignty.
@Empire3Description=At the same time the New Conglomerate seceded from the Terran Republic, the Vanu Sovereignty was also formed. Unlike the New Conglomerate, which simply wanted more freedom, and the Terran Republic, which was fighting to regain control, the Vanu Sovereignty embraced the alien Vanu technology found on Auraxis, going so far as to name themselves the Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nThe Vanu Sovereignty believes that being cut off from the main Terran Republic Empire was a blessing, allowing them to officially separate and form their own Empire to unearth and utilize Vanu technology. They view the Terran Republic with open disdain, and don't trust the New Conglomerate's ‘freer' society motivation. Ultimately, they feel that neither of the opposing Empires understands the true potential of the Vanu technology, and therefore the Vanu Sovereignty openly combats the New Conglomerate and Terran Republic in an effort to preserve and control all discovered Vanu technology.\n\nUnlike the New Conglomerate and Terran Republic, which have more traditionally-based weaponry and vehicles, the Vanu Sovereignty has ‘interpreted' Vanu science into hybrids of man-made and Vanu technology, examples of which consist largely of energy-based weaponry and hover vehicles.

@ilc9_info=The AMP is designed for close-range combat. It is the only rapid-fire pistol and can empty a full clip extremely quickly. However, it suffers from  poor recoil, causing it to be very inaccurate when fired beyond a close range.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@repeater_info=The primary sidearm for the Terran Republic is the Repeater pistol. As with all Terran Republic technology, the Repeater's design focuses on a swift firing rate and good ammo base. What the Repeater lacks in power it makes up with these attributes.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@suppressor_info=An effective, light-weight, and compact submachine gun, the Suppressor is a solid close-quarters weapon. And with its low recoil, it's easy to aim and utilize in combat.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@isp_info=Essentially a handheld shotgun pistol, the Scatter Pistol is primarily designed for close quarter combat. Due to its short barrel design, the Scatter Pistol isn't very effective beyond close range.\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@beamer_info=The Beamer is the primary sidearm of Vanu Sovereingty soldiers. It is a high power/short range energy weapon, capable of inflicting notable damage on enemy soldiers. The primary drawback the Beamer suffers from is degradation of the beam's power over range, resulting in weaker hits at long distances.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <medium assault>
@cycler_info=The Cycler is the fastest firing assault rifle. It is also equipped with an enhanced magnification of four times, allowing it to effectively target distant enemies. It uses a cylinder drum for its ammunition source.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@flechette_info=Built on standard shotgun technology, the Sweeper fires a burst of slugs which are capable of piercing MAX armor at close range. Subsequently it's a useful weapon not only against soldiers, but light vehicles as well.\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@punisher_info=The Punisher is a well-rounded assault rifle that incorporates not just a standard automatic firing mode, but comes equipped with a launcher that is capable of firing either rocklets or grenades. Its standard firing mode delivers reliable short to medium range combat capability.\nWhile it can effectively reach long range, its limited zooming makes aiming effectively somewhat of a hindrance.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).\nSecondary mode uses either rocklets, fragmentation grenades, plasma grenades, or jammer grenades.
@gauss_info=Using magnetic field technology, the Gauss assault rifle combines standard combustion-based ammunition with a magnetic field that boosts the actual projectile speed when fired. This allows the Gauss to use standard ammunition more effectively than other assault rifles.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@pulsar_info=The Pulsar automatic assault rifle is a highly effective weapon utilized by the Vanu Sovereignty. With minimum recoil due to its energy-based technology, the Pulsar can be devastating at short to medium range.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <sniper>
@bolt_driver_info=The Bolt Driver is a powerful sniper rifle and is capable of killing lightly armored enemy soldiers in a single shot. It suffers from only being able to load a single bolt at a time, thus requiring reloading after every shot.\nAmmo: Bolt.

# <heavy assault>
@mini_chaingun_info=The Mini Chaingun is a heavy assault machine gun that is designed to rapidly spit out rounds from a generous ammo base. While not particularly damaging per shot, the sheer speed at which it fires can easily rip apart an enemy soldier.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@r_shotgun_info=The Jackhammer is a heavy assault shotgun with a unique secondary fire mode.\n\nWhen firing in secondary mode, all three barrels are fired in rapid succession, faster than would occur if you pulled the trigger normally. This results in incredible carnage in a short period of time.\n\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@lasher_info=The Lasher fires a special concentrated energy 'orb' that lashes out against any soldiers or vehicles at close range as it moves past them. The damage it delivers is variable, based on whether it actually hits a target or simply lashes it. A target that is lashed may receive several minor damage hits, while a target that is directly impacted by the orb receives a single large impact.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <anti-vehicular>
@hunterseeker_info=The Phoenix uses wire-guided technology to allow the operator to literally fly the missile into the intended target. As soon as the missile is fired, the operator switches to a camera mounted on the tip of the warhead. While the missile is in flight, the operator can either directly fly the missile to impact, or press the primary fire key anytime during flight to detonate the warhead immediately (in case of a near miss).\nAmmo: Phoenix missile.
@striker_info=The Striker serves as the Terran Republic's main anti-vehicular missile launcher. When in primary firing mode, the Striker will attempt to lock-on to an armored target (heavy assault suit, vehicle, or turret) as long as the reticule is kept on the target for a short duration. Once lock-on is achieved, a lock-on confirmation is displayed, along with a confirmation tone. At this point tapping the primary fire key will launch the missile and it will home in on the respective target. In secondary firing mode, it launches a dumbfire missile where it's aimed.\nAmmo: Striker missile.
@lancer_info=The Lancer is a shoulder-mounted beam weapon that the Vanu Sovereignty utilize in combating enemy vehicles. It is specifically designed to inflict high damage versus armored targets.\nAmmo: Lancer cartridge.

# <special assault>
@rocklet_info=The Rocklet Rifle carries a small payload of rocklets which are effective up to medium range. Each rocklet delivers a reasonably powerful explosive force. It possesses no guidance capabilities making it a dumbfire projectile. When in secondary mode, pressing the trigger launches all rocklets in rapid succession, emptying the weapon of any remaining rocklets.\nAmmo: Rocket pod.
@thumper_info=A standard grenade launcher, the Thumper can lob grenades to a medium range and can be used for indirect fire.\nAmmo: Fragmentation, jammer, or plasma Grenade Packs.
@phoenix_info=The Decimator is an extremely powerful missile launcher utilizing a disposable design; once all three of its pre-loaded shots are fired, the Decimator launcher is useless and discarded. In standard mode, the Decimator is a dumbfire missile launcher.\n\nIf you want to get a closer view of your target, you can also fire this weapon in a secondary firing mode that allows a dumb-fire projectile with you attached in camera view. Use this tactically to spy out a remote position.\n\nAmmo: Built-in (fire and forget after three shots)

# AMMUNITION
# <hand-held ammo>
@9mmbullet_info=The standard bullet used in most projectile weapons, this ammunition is best against 'soft' targets.
@9mmbullet_AP_info=This armor-piercing ammunition penetrates the heavier armor of vehicles, MAXs, and equipment such as terminals, generators, and deployables.
@shotgun_shell_info=The standard shell for all shotgun-based weapons, this cartridge is best used against 'soft' targets.
@shotgun_shell_AP_info=This armor-piercing shotgun slug penetrates the heavier armor of vehicles, MAXs, and equipment such as terminals, generators, and deployables.
@rocket_info=This ammunition fits into all weapons that utilize small rockets. Although slow-moving, it delivers a hard localized explosion to its target.
@frag_cartridge_info=This fragmentation grenade ammunition delivers explosive concussion to its target.
@plasma_cartridge_info=The plasma grenade explodes and splashes intense plasma on a target, burning it continuously over a period of time after the explosion.
@jammer_cartridge_info=The jammer grenade causes loss of power to many systems in its area of effect. This includes loss of power to turrets, motion sensors, the resetting of implant timers on soldiers in that area, and disruption of radar.
@bolt_info=The large caliber round used by the Bolt Driver sniper rifle.
@striker_missile_ammo_info=The unique missile required for the Striker missile launcher.
@hunter_seeker_missile_info=The ammunition used in the New Conglomerate Phoenix launcher.
@energy_cell_info=These energy cells are used in all Vanu Sovereignty beam-type weapons except the Lancer.
@lancer_cartridge_info=This large-capacity energy cell powers the Lancer anti-vehicular energy beam.

# <heavy armor ammo>
@burster_ammo_info=The 'flak' cannon ammunition used by a MAX designed to be used on enemy aircraft.
@dualcycler_ammo_info=The large-caliber ammunition used by a MAX to tear apart 'soft' targets and chip away at more armored ones.
@pounder_ammo_info=The indirect grenade ammunition used by a MAX.
@sparrow_ammo_info=These missiles can lock and home in on enemy aircraft. Used by a Sparrow MAX.
@scattercannon_ammo_info=This tri-pattern heavy shotgun can be set to wide spread (with a short range), average spread (with a medium range), or tight spread (with a long range).
@falcon_ammo_info=This dumbfire missile launcher packs a heavy punch and is best used against heavily armored targets.
@starfire_ammo_info=These small plasma spheres can track enemy aircraft, home in, and splash burn those vehicles.
@quasar_ammo_info=Effectively, a very heavy version of the Pulsar assault rifle, the Quasar fills the anti-infantry role on the battlefield.
@comet_ammo_info=Shooting spheres of energy plasma that explode around the target area causing aggravated damage to all within that area. This weapon is particularly suited to destroying ground vehicles.

# <equipment ammo>
@armor_canister_info=Armor canisters are used by BANK devices, as well as Nano-dispensers and are used to repair damage to armor and mechanical devices.
@health_canister_info=Health canisters are used by medical applicators and are used to regenerate the Health of living tissue.

# <vehicle ammo>
@105mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 100 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the 100 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFProwler\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe 100 mm Cannon lacks the power of the 150 mm Cannon, but enjoys a faster refire rate and moderate recoil penalties.
@12mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 12 mm Rotary Chaingun.\nThe following vehicles use the 12 mm Rotary Chaingun:\n\\#00FFFFBasilisk, Harasser, Lightning, Marauder, Mosquito, Prowler\n\n\\#FFFFFFDesigned primarily as an anti-infantry weapon, the Rotary Chaingun is a high-speed machine gun capable of projecting rounds at an extremely fast rate. While each round itself does little damage, the refire rate more than compensates, and the Rotary Chaingun is capable of delivering damage through aggregate means. The Rotary Chaingun does suffer from recoil, however, and firing in full automatic mode can easily reduce accuracy - it's ideally suited for firing in bursts at close to medium range.
@150mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 150 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the 150 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFVanguard\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe most powerful anti-vehicular cannon on a per shot basis, the 150 mm Cannon combines devastating power, proximity damage, and long range capabilities to make it an ideal anti-tank weapon. The 150 mm does suffer from a poor refire rate, but is nonetheless the king of vehicular cannons.
@20mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon.\nThe following vehicles use the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFDeliverer, Galaxy, Reaver, Vanguard\n\n\\#FFFFFFWhile the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon doesn't have the blazing refire rate found on other machine gun class weapons such as the Rotary Chaingun, it nonetheless makes up with increased damage per shot and improved accuracy. The 20 mm Recoilless Cannon can be used effectively against infantry as well as lightly armored vehicles even over long range.
@75mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 75 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicles use the 75 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFLightning, Sunderer\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe 75 mm Cannon launches explosive shells that inflict heavy damage against vehicles and moderate damage against infantry. A reasonable refire rate gives the 75 mm a somewhat balanced role as both anti-vehicular and anti-infantry. Each shell is explosive and damages a small area effect.
@pulse_particle_accelerator_info=Ammunition for the Pulse Particle Accelerator.\nThe following vehicle uses the Pulse Particle Accelerator:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially an automatic laser machine gun. The individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic. The pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they dissipate. As with the Rotary Chaingun and 20 mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@pulse_battery_info=Ammunition for the Pulse Particle Accelerator.\nThe following vehicle uses the Pulse Particle Accelerator:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially an automatic laser machine gun. The individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic. The pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they dissipate. As with the Rotary Chaingun and 20 mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@proximity_mine_info=The Proximity Mine is extremely powerful, designed primarily as an anti-vehicular weapon.
@groundpounder_info=Ammunition for the GroundPounder Heavy Grenade Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the GroundPounder:\n\\#00FFFFMarauder\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe GroundPounder inflicts most of its damage through proximity radius. When fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases in a linear manner to the proximity's edge. Due to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@heavy_grenade_mortar_info=Ammunition for the GroundPounder Heavy Grenade Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the GroundPounder:\n\\#00FFFFMarauder\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe GroundPounder inflicts most of its damage through proximity radius. When fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases in a linear manner to the proximity's edge. Due to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@fluxcannon_info=Ammunition for the Flux Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the Flux Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFThresher\n\n\\#FFFFFFConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies. While an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75 mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate. When fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@flux_cannon_thresher_battery_info=Ammunition for the Flux Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the Flux Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFThresher\n\n\\#FFFFFFConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies. While an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75 mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate. When fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@railbeam_info=Ammunition for the Rail Beam.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rail Beam:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFExtremely precise and powerful, the Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects. The Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@heavy_rail_beam_battery_info=Ammunition for the Rail Beam.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rail Beam:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFExtremely precise and powerful, the Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects. The Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@firebird_missile_info=Ammunition for the Firebird Rocket Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Firdbird Rocket Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFEnforcer\n\n\\#FFFFFFLaunching potent rockets at a fairly rapid rate, the Firebird is extremely useful when mounted on mobile armor.\n\nThe refire rate is average, but each rocket delivers both solid damage and a reasonable proximity effect when exploding.\n\nThe projectiles travel at a fairly swift rate when launched, but are best used against close- to medium-range vehicular targets. Targets at longer ranges can generally undertake evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit by a Firebird rocket.
@reaver_rocket_info=Ammunition for the Rocket Pod Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rocket Pod Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFReaver\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe Rocket Pod Launcher swiftly dispenses a solid payload of small dumbfire rockets. Due to the dumbfire nature of the rockets, it's most effectively used at close range, where both soldiers and vehicles alike can become victims of direct hits or the collective splash damage.

# ARMOR TYPES
@standard_issue_armor_info=This is the armor you respawn in after dying. It has very little protection, can carry a pistol and a rifle, and has a small inventory space. It's best to avoid using this armor whenever possible, since everyone on Auraxis can also use Agile Armor, which is superior. However, you'll need to get Agile Armor from a nearby Equipment Terminal.
@lite_armor_info=With about twice the armor of Standard, and the flexibility of a second pistol slot and larger inventory, the Agile Armor is a vast improvement over Standard. You still maintain good footspeed and this is the heaviest armor you can wear and still pilot/drive all vehicles.
@med_armor_info=This is the heaviest non-MAX armor out there. With two pistol slots, two rifle slots, and a large inventory space, this armor is great stuff. However, the bulk of the armor reduces your footspeed and is a significant trade-off.
@stealth_armor_info=While this is not technically armor, the "stealth suit" allows you to cloak yourself on the battlefield to avoid visual detection. It provides NO armor protection and has very little inventory space, and only a single pistol slot, but is extremely useful anyway.
@trhev_antiaircraft_info=This Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) uses twin Bursters to throw 'flak' projectiles into the sky and is designed to destroy enemy aircraft. The rate of fire when Anchored makes these weapons especially formidable.
@trhev_antipersonnel_info=Using the Dual-Cyclers mounted on its arms, this anti-vehicular configuration of the MAX (Mechanized Assault eXo-suit) can unleash great volumes of lead in any direction, especially when Anchored.
@trhev_antivehicular_info=The arm-mounted Pounders on this MAX are highly explosive indirect-fire weapons that can be unleashed at a high rate of fire, especially when the MAX is Anchored.
@nchev_antiaircraft_info=This MAX uses the Sparrow Missile Launcher to track and destroy enemy aircraft.
@nchev_antipersonnel_info=The heavy assault Scattercannon is typically used by this MAX to destroy enemy personnel and cause collateral damage.
@nchev_antivehicular_info=The dumbfire Falcon used by this Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) can punch through the heaviest of armor and is used widely to destroy enemy ground vehicles.
@vshev_antiaircraft_info=This MAX uses the Starfire weapon to home in and destroy enemy aircraft.
@vshev_antipersonnel_info=This nimble MAX uses the Quasar rifle to destroy enemy personnel and create collateral damage.
@vshev_antivehicular_info=The Comet anti-armor weaponry is used by this Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) to destroy enemy armor and ground targets.

# MISC EQUIPMENT
@ace_info=The ACE uses nano-tech to create matrix patterns in one of four varieties. Used by Combat Engineers exclusively, the ACE can be deployed as either a High-Explosive Mine, a remote-detonated Boomer, a deployable Spitfire turret, or a deployable Motion Sensor Alarm. 
@bank_info=The Body Armor Nano Kit, or BANK, is designed to repair damaged body armor. The BANK requires a Engineering certification in order to utilize its functionality. The BANK uses an Armor Canister as fuel to repair Body Armor - when the Armor Canister is depleted, the soldier can load another Armor Canister (if carried).
@frag_grenade_info=Fragmentation grenades skewer their blast radius with shrapnel when exploding. Soldiers are particularly vulnerable to fragmentation grenades, as the shrapnel can easily pierce body armor. The closer the soldier is to the fragmentation grenade when it explodes, the higher the damage quotient (due to the increased chance of being hit by shrapnel). It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.
@jammer_grenade_info=Designed specifically to interfere with exposed electrical systems, the Jammer grenade doesn't impart any physical damage, but can play havoc with a myriad of electrical equipment. Any electrical equipment caught within a Jammer grenade's blast will be affected. The effects of the Jammer grenade are also proximity-based; the closer electrical equipment is to the epicenter, the longer the jamming effect. It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.\nJammers can disrupt the function of turrets and motion sensors, they reset the implant timers on all soldiers in the area, and they confuse radar images for those affected.
@medkit_info=The standard Med-Kit restores health points to a soldier. This can be done quickly, in the field, when injured and in an urgent situation.\n\nNOTE: A hotkey is automatically created on your hotbar the first time you put a medkit in your inventory. To use that medkit, simply tap the appropriate F-key to activate it.
@medicalapplicator_info=The Applicator is a multi-purpose medical tool that can be administered to self or other friendly soldiers. The Applicator uses a standard Health canister for performing any function, and each respective function consumes varying amounts of reservoir points. When a Health canister is emptied, a soldier can load a new canister (if carried). 
@mine_sweeper_info=The Mine Sweeper is a small electrical device that emits a specialized magnetic field that will trigger and instantly destroy any enemy mines within its radius. The Mine Sweeper is actually treated like a grenade in usage - the player literally throws it into an area at which point it explodes, destroying any enemy mines within its radius.
@nano_dispenser_info=The NanoDispenser is a large repair device that is held similarly to a two-handed assault rifle. A soldier can repair any damaged object or vehicle using the NanoDispenser, and uses reservoir points for fuel when repairing. The NanoDispenser requires a Engineering certification in order to utilize its functionality. It uses a replaceable Armor Canister for fuel.
@plasma_grenade_info=The Plasma grenade contains highly-compressed plasma which sprays an area and any unfortunate nearby soldiers, objects, or vehicles with burning plasma when exploding. Any soldiers, objects, or vehicles hit by the scathing plasma will continue to receive aggravated damage until the plasma's heat naturally subsides (or the recipient perishes). It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.
@remote_electronics_kit_info=The Remote Electronics Kit (REK) is a hand-held hacking device that interfaces withenemy terminals at close range. Most REK functions require either Hacking or Advanced Hacking certifications, but there are also standard functions that don't require any hacking certifications such as hacking enemy door IFFs and control consoles.\n\nSoldiers with a Hacking certification can hack enemy terminals for use by friendly troops, including equipment terminals, vehicle terminals, implant terminals and more. They also hack doors and control consoles faster than soldiers without a Hacking certification.\n\nAn Advanced Hacker does everything a Hacker can do, but does it at very fast speeds, thus minimizing risk to the hacker.\n\nHackers and Advanced Hackers can also 'jack' enemy vehicles, switching them from the enemy empire's control to your own.
@command_detonater_info=This uplink device is only available to Rank 2 Commanders and above.\n\nThis mechanism is used to communicate with automatic systems high above Auraxis in the Orbital Station.\n\nMost timed command abilities require the equipping of this item before they will function.

@twomanhoverbuggy=Thresher
@twomanhoverbuggyd=Destroyed Thresher
@twomanhoverbuggys=Threshers
@twomanhoverbuggyinfo=The Vanu Sovereignty's version of a Heavy Buggy is built upon a gravitic drive system that replaces the usual wheels with 4 anti grav pods that propel the buggy. It sports a horizontally-limited Flux Cannon that serves as the primary weapon. Though the Vanu Sovereignty's version of an Assault Buggy may not be as armored or feature the wide firing arcs that other Empires have, its hover capabilities allow it to effectively strafe left or right thus offsetting some of its other disadvantages with increased maneuverability. In addition, this hover capability allows the Vanu Sovereignty hover buggy to sustain travel over water for short periods of time, allowing it to easily ford small rivers and ponds.
@twomanhoverbuggy_destroyed=Your Thresher has been destroyed.

@twomanheavybuggy=Enforcer
@twomanheavybuggyd=Destroyed Enforcer
@twomanheavybuggys=Enforcers
@twomanheavybuggyinfo=The New Conglomerate's version of a heavy buggy sports an Advanced Rocket Launcher mounted in an open 360 degree turret located above and behind the driver.\n\nThe ARL (aka Firebird) is a single barreled rocket launcher that automatically reloads after firing providing extra rockets are available in the 'trunk space' of the vehicle.
@twomanheavybuggy_destroyed=Your Enforcer has been destroyed.

@threemanheavybuggy=Marauder
@threemanheavybuggyd=Destroyed Marauder
@threemanheavybuggys=Marauders
@threemanheavybuggyinfo=The Marauder heavy buggy sports more armor, fire power, and passengers than the buggies of other Empires. The primary weapon system consists of a 360-degree capable heavy proximity grenade launcher (Ground Pounder) mounted in the rear.  The Grenade Launcher is a relatively short barreled weapon that can fire off several rounds before needing to reload. The secondary weapon system is a 12 mm Rotary Chaingun mounted to the right of the driver. 
@threemanheavybuggy_destroyed=Your Marauder has been destroyed.

@quadassault=Basilisk
@quadassaultd=Destroyed Basilisk
@quadassaults=Basilisks
@quadassaultinfo=The four-wheeled ATV Assault Quad is the most agile attack vehicle, combining reasonably potent offensive capabilities and speed. The primary weakness of the Assault Quad is its light armor that allows the vehicle its superior handling.\n\nThe General Assault Quad has Light Rotary Chainguns mounted side-by-side in front of the rider.
@quadassault_destroyed=Your Basilisk has been destroyed.

@quadstealth=Wraith
@quadstealthd=Destroyed Wraith
@quadstealths=Stealth Wraiths
@quadstealthinfo=The fastest and most agile of all land-based vehicles, the Wraith trades armor and all offensive capabilities for sheer speed, maneuverability, and stealth. Designed specifically as a reconnaissance vehicle, the Wraith has a unique light refraction system that effectively cloaks it visually at long range only if the rider is wearing a Stealth Suit. The integrated stealth system complements the light fraction, removing the Wraith from most radar systems. In addition a white noise generator helps to dampen the Wraith's engine noise.
@quadstealth_destroyed=Your Wraith has been destroyed.

@vanguard=Vanguard
@vanguardd=Destroyed Vanguard
@vanguards=Vanguards
@vanguardinfo=The Vanguard is the main battle tank for the New Conglomerate. Generally well balanced, the Vanguard brings decent speed, solid armor, and hefty firepower to the field. The main turret pivots 360 degrees and houses a 150mm Tank Cannon. The gunner can also switch to a limited pivot 20mm Recoilless Cannon for infantry supression.
@vanguard_destroyed=Your Vanguard has been destroyed.

@lightning=Lightning
@lightningd=Destroyed Lightning
@lightnings=Lightnings
@lightninginfo=The Lightning is a single seated mini tank which is fairly fast but lacking much in the way of armor, making it best suited to running escort or in packs. The Lightning is outfitted with a 75mm Tank Cannon as it's primary weapon. Next to the Cannon is a secondary Light Rotary Chaingun used as an anti-infantry weapon.
@lightning_destroyed=Your Lightning has been destroyed.

@prowler=Prowler
@prowlerd=Destroyed Prowler
@prowlers=Prowlers
@prowlerinfo=The Prowler is the largest Main Battle Tank. Having the most armor for a Tank and a 360-degree capable dual 100mm heavy tank turret, the Prowler is certainly able to devastate many targets in short order. The secondary gunner is able to control a dual Rotary Chaingun which is a small turret stacked upon the primary turret. Naturally the sheer size, weight, and firepower of this tank makes it slower than any of the Main Battle tanks.
@prowler_destroyed=Your Prowler has been destroyed.

@magrider=Magrider
@magriderd=Destroyed Magrider
@magriders=Magriders
@magriderinfo=The Magrider is the Vanu Sovereignty's Main Battle Tank.\n\nBuilt upon Vanu Alien technology, it has the ability to hover across both ground and water.\n\nThis propulsion system also gives the Magrider the ability to strafe left or right. The drawback, however, is that the Sovereignty has not perfected the anti-gravitic drive yet so weight is still a critical issue.\n\nBecause of this, their primary weapon, a heavy energy rail beam has a limited forward pivot.\n\nThe secondary weapon system, which the pilot controls, is a light Pulsed Particle Accelerator, and is mounted on the front of the vehicle.  
@magrider_destroyed=Your Magrider has been destroyed.

@mosquito=Mosquito
@mosquitod=Destroyed Mosquito
@mosquitos=Mosquitoes
@mosquitoinfo=The Mosquito is fast, agile, and lightly armored. It carries only a Light Rotary Chaingun (12mm), but it can easily slip past most sensory defenses (it's not visible on radar) and is primarly a scout craft. The Mosquito only carries a single pilot.
@mosquito_destroyed=Your Mosquito has been destroyed.

@lightgunship=Reaver
@lightgunshipd=Destroyed Reaver
@lightgunships=Reavers
@lightgunshipinfo=The Reaver carries much more armor and ordnance than the lighter Mosquito. Of course, this makes it less maneuverable, but the Reaver is easily the king of the skies with it's forward-firing 20mm Recoilless Cannon and secondary firing Rocket Launchers. The Reaver, like the Mosquito, carries only a single pilot.
@lightgunship_destroyed=Your Reaver has been destroyed.

@dropship=Galaxy
@dropshipd=Destroyed Galaxy
@dropships=Galaxies
@dropshipinfo=The Galaxy is a gigantic aircraft capable of carrying a pilot, three gunners, two MAXs, six other passengers, as well as a vehicle in the back (with passengers). Fully loaded, with passengers in the vehicle stowed in back, the Galaxy can easily carry a full Squad of soldiers, plus a pilot and gun crew to bring them to the battle intact and alive. The gunner positions have 20mm Chainguns to use in defense against airborne targets, or they can be alternately used to pound ground targets from above.
@dropship_destroyed=Your Galaxy has been destroyed.

@orbital_shuttle=High Altitude Reentry Transport (HART)
@orbital_shuttled=Destroyed HART
@orbital_shuttles=HARTs
@orbital_shuttle_ob=High Altitude Reentry Transport (HART)
@orbital_shuttle_obd=Destroyed HART

@orbital_shuttle_osd=Destroyed HART
@orbital_shuttle_oss=HARTs
@obbasemesh=Orbital Drop Facility
@Shuttle1Title=HART One
@Shuttle2Title=HART Two

@ams=Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)
@amsd=Destroyed Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)
@amss=Advanced Mobile Stations (AMSs)
@amsinfo=The Advanced Mobile Station is the lynchpin in many attack strategies. Once driven to a location and deployed, the AMS allows soldiers to store their patterns at its respawning tubes for quick redeployment after death. It also carries a full Equipment Terminal allowing soldiers to reequip in the field. When deployed, the AMS automatically cloaks beyond a short distance in order to better shield it from enemy troops.
@ams_destroyed=Your Advanced Mobile Station has been destroyed.
@ams_decaystarted=The AMS you are bound to has lost its' owner.  It will auto-deconstruct in 15 minutes.
@ams_decayed=The AMS you are bound to has been auto-deconstructed due to lack of owner.
@ams_deconstructed=The AMS you are bound to has been deconstructed by its owner.

@ant=Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)
@antd=Destroyed Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)
@ants=Advanced Nanite Transports (ANTs)
@antinfo=The Advanced Nanite Transport is the backbone of the system to draw energy from the ancient Vanu warp bubbles.\n\nUsable by all members of all Empires, the ANT is driven to warp gate bubbles where it deploys its charging vanes.\n\nOnce the capacitors onboard are filled, the ANT is driven to a battle facility and deployed near a Silo. The energy then coruscates over to the Silo collector and the facility gains enough energy to be fully powered for a time.
@ant_destroyed=Your ANT has been destroyed.

@apc=Sunderer
@apcd=Destroyed Sunderer
@apcs=Sunderers
@apcinfo=The Sunderer is a large, lumbering heavy ground transport capable of carrying a driver, two gunners, six passengers, and two MAXs. The gunners man two large 75mm Tank Cannons to be used in defense against vehicles, but depend on squad members disembarking to protect against infantry attack.
@apc_destroyed=Your Sunderer has been destroyed.

@mediumtransport=Deliverer
@mediumtransportd=Destroyed Deliverer
@mediumtransports=Deliverers
@mediumtransportinfo=The Deliverer is a medium transport capable of carrying up to five occupants (1 driver, 2 gunners, 2 passengers). While less maneuverable than assault buggies, the Deliverer has two gunners -- one next to the driver, facing forward, the other in the rear, covering the back. A reasonable trunk provides adequate space to carry supplies as well.\n\nThe Deliverer also has the distinct advantage of being able to cross calm rivers and waterways. When entering water, the Deliverer will float at the surface, but is only capable of 30% of its maximum speed when crossing water.
@mediumtransport_destroyed=Your Deliverer has been destroyed.

@droppod=Drop Pod
@droppodd=Destroyed Drop Pod
@droppods=Drop Pods
@droppodinfo=The Drop Pod allows reentry through the atmosphere down to the planet below.
@droppod_destroyed=Your Drop Pod has been destroyed.

# Help Text for the droppods

# Implant Description Strings
#---------------------------------------------------------
@ImplantTerminalTitle=Implant Terminal
@Advanced_Regen_Descrip=Health Regeneration allows you to use Stamina points to quickly regenerate missing Health points at the cost of two Stamina points for each Health point regained.
@Targeting_Descrip=Advanced Targeting allows you to see the name and health of enemy characters under your reticule. It also reveals the names of enemies within a vehicle, as well as revealing enemy deployables at a greater range.
@Audio_Amplifier_Descrip=This implant amplifies footsteps of nearby soldiers, allowing onboard systems to analyze that sound and place enemy soldier locations on your personal radar, thus revealing their position when they are running.
@Darklight_Vision_Descrip=The Darklight implant greatly reduces your normal visibility while simultaneously shifting your perceptions to allow you to see cloaked enemies in an area around you.
@Melee_Booster_Descrip=This implant drains a soldier's Stamina when he swings a knife, but greatly enhances the damage of that knife when it hits.
@Personal_Shield_Descrip=This implant harnesses a soldier's Stamina and turns it into a personal force field that blocks incoming damage on a one for one basis.
@Range_Magnifier_Descrip=This implant is used instead of a weapon's normal zoom function, but has much greater capacity. Zoom levels are 4x, 8x, and 12x.
@Second_Wind_Descrip=When a soldier is on the brink of death, the Second Wind implant automatically strips Stamina away to boost Health to safer levels. After each use, a recharge period must elapse before Second Wind can be used again.
@Silent_Run_Descrip=Using counter-frequency technology, the Silent Run implant completely nullifies the sounds of the soldier's footsteps. The bulkier the armor being worn, the more Stamina is used to muffle the footstep sounds.
@Surge_Descrip=This implant boosts the footspeed of a soldier by draining his Stamina to power enhanced leg units. The bulkier the armor being worn, the more Stamina is required to achieve the Surge in speed.

# Certification descriptions
#---------------------------------------------------------
@CertDescription_standard_assault=Allows a soldier to utilize the AMP and Suppressor. Empire-specific weaponry available through this certification includes the Beamer (VS), Repeater (TR), and Scatter-Pistol (NC)
@CertDescription_medium_assault=The Sweeper and Punisher are available through this certification. Empire-specific weaponry available includes the Pulsar (VS), Cycler (TR), and Gauss Rifle (NC)
@CertDescription_heavy_assault=Heavy assault weapons for each empire are the Lasher (VS), Mini-Chaingun (TR), and Jackhammer (NC)
@CertDescription_special_assault=These weapons include the Decimator, Rocklet Rifle, and Thumper (all common pool)
@CertDescription_anti_vehicular=Empire-specific weaponry includes the Lancer (VS), Striker (TR), and Phoenix (NC)
@CertDescription_sniper=This certification allows a soldier to use the Bolt Driver sniper rifle.
@CertDescription_advanced_nanite_transport=The Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT) is the vehicle used to collect energy at warp gates and transport it to a Silo for use as an energy source for the facility.\n\nThe ANT itself is a machine designed to generate billions of nanites (of a pattern extrapolated from old Vanu records). Those nanites are able to extract energy from the dimensional flux inside a warp bubble and act like tiny batteries.\n\nWhen an ANT deploys near a Silo, the carrier beam from the ANT forces the nanites to move to the Silo.\n\nThe Silo closely, but not exactly, emulates the environment found in the warp bubbles. (Silos are human tech and Humanity isn't close to understading all the inter-dimensional physics techniques.) Because the Silo is imperfect, the nanites can't generate new power from the faux-warp environment and eventually die out, requiring them to be resupplied.\n\nIn the act of dissolution, the nanite's expiration releases the stored energy within them to the collectors within the Silo. The Silo harnesses that energy for use by the facilities and the ANT makes another round trip to keep the facility supplied.
@CertDescription_quad_stealth=The Wraith is a four-wheeled cycle with stealth capabilities *IF* you are wearing an Infiltration Suit. Otherwise, it acts as a normal four-wheeled cycle.

# Static Object Messages
@xp_adv_med_terminal_label=Advanced Medical Station
@xp_adv_med_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Advanced Medical Station. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this station.
@xp_adv_med_terminal_message=ADVANCED MEDICAL STATION\n\nThis advanced medical station scans your matrix, looking for abnormalities. Nanites are then activated within your body while you're in the scanning field, and any defects to both health AND armor are repaired.\n\nOnce you step into the Advanced Medical Station, you will automatically begin healing/repairing.\n\nYou can step out of the station at any time to interrupt this process.\n\nIf your Empire owns a Bio Lab elsewhere on the continent, then this terminal will act as an Advanced Medical Terminal and will repair armor as well as heal body damage.
@xp_air_vehicle_terminal_label=Air Vehicle Terminal
@xp_air_vehicle_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Air Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_air_vehicle_message=AIR VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\nFast-attack aircraft are found here.\n\nTo acquire an air vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad located directly outside. You must claim it (by sitting in the pilot position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_air_vehicle_terminal_message=AIR VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\nFast-attack aircraft are found here.\n\nTo acquire an air vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad located directly outside. You must claim it (by sitting in the pilot position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_capture_terminal_label=Control Terminal
@xp_capture_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Control Terminal.
@xp_capture_terminal_message=CONTROL TERMINAL\n\nThe nerve center of each facility, the Control Terminal interfaces with the Human tech terminals in the building and is also the mechanism used to converse with the Vanu tech at the core of the planet.\n\nBy introducing viral code via a hand-held REK unit, this core can be made to conform to other Empire parameter sets.\n\nThus, the Control Terminal is both a strength (interface between human and Vanu tech) as well as a weakness (other Empires can exploit its singular control to take over the base).\n\nBecause of this, it is typically guarded quite securely by intelligent defenders.
@xp_certification_terminal_label=Certification Terminal
@xp_certification_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Certification Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_certification_terminal_message=CERTIFICATION TERMINAL\n\nThis terminal interfaces with your Empire's military records and programs the smart-chip embedded in your body to allow access to various vehicles, weapons, and equipment.\n\nWithout such programming, you will not be granted access to utilize that equipment.\n\nUse this terminal to spend Certification Points awarded by your Empire to unlock access to weapons, vehicles, equipment, and armors.
@xp_deconstruction_label=Respawn Tube
@xp_deconstruction_descrip=You are facing a Respawn Tube. You are awarded 50 BEP for visiting this tube.
@xp_deconstruction_message=RESPAWN TUBE\n\nAfter death, you will respawn in a tube like this one.\n\nYou may also voluntarily deconstruct yourself within this tube so that you can reappear in other allowed respawn locations.
@xp_external_door_lock_label=Security Lock
@xp_external_door_lock_descrip=You are facing a Security Lock. You are awarded 100 BEP for investigating this lock.
@xp_external_door_lock_message=SECURITY LOCK\n\nEach door to the outside world is equipped with anti-viral encoding to prevent hackers from penetrating this passive defense.\n\nOf course, it's only a matter of time for a dedicated hacker to work through those code defenses.\n\nEven average soldiers can use a REK to pass through a secured door, if they have enough uninterrupted time.
@xp_galaxy_terminal_label=Air Transport Terminal
@xp_galaxy_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Air Transport Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_galaxy_terminal_message=AIR TRANSPORT TERMINAL\n\nThis facility has the power and space to create the giant Galaxy dropships, as well as the smaller Mosquitoes and Reavers as well.\n\nTo acquire one of these air vehicles, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad located directly outside. You must claim it (by sitting in the pilot position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_generator_label=Facility Generator
@xp_generator_descrip=You are facing this facility's generator. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting the generator.
@xp_generator_message=FACILITY GENERATOR\n\nThis large generator takes the energy stored in the Silo's nannites and converts it into a form useable by Human technology.\n\nIf destroyed, all elements needing power in this facility (except the Control Terminal which runs on an independent power source) will be disabled until the generator is repaired.\n\nWhen disabled, the generator will self-repair over time using existing nanites and the scant power released by passive systems within the generator.\n\nThis automated repair process can be boosted by manually repairing the generator with a Nano-Dispenser.
@xp_ground_vehicle_terminal_label=Ground Vehicle Terminal
@xp_ground_vehicle_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Ground Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_ground_vehicle_terminal_message=GROUND VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\nGround vehicles are available at this terminal.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to investigate the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button on your Soldier Management Menu. (NOTE: That menu is raised by clicking the 'Soldier Management Menu' button on the right side of your 'Status' pane...the one with healthbars and holsters.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_implant_terminal_label=Implant Terminal
@xp_implant_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Implant Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_implant_terminal_message=IMPLANT TERMINAL\n\nUpon stepping into the Implant Terminal, you are dematrixed, reconfigured and formed into a new whole with additional (and authorized) capabilities, a better soldier for your Empire.\n\nChoose among the various Implants available, and click on the 'Install Implant' button at the bottom of the screen in order to gain use of that implant and exit the terminal.\n\nImplants are easily removed by using the 'Remove Implant' button.\n\nYou will gain one Implant slot for every six Battle Ranks you achieve.\n\nEach Implant has an 'activation time' that must pass before the implant can be used. This activation time occurs after initially installing the implant, but also occurs when being re-matrixed at a respawning tube.
@xp_locker_label=Equipment Locker
@xp_locker_descrip=You are facing an Equipment Locker. You are awarded 100 BEP for investigating this locker.
@xp_locker_message=EQUIPMENT LOCKER\n\nWhen your generator has been destroyed, you have no access to equipment terminals.\n\nAt times like that, a few items securely stored away in your Locker can be of great assistance.\n\nYour locker is virtual and is stored in your Empire's database. When you access the door to your locker, all items are reconstructed from pattern, thus allowing your Locker to be accessed anywhere within your Empire's holdings.\n\nNeedless to say, because of that, you cannot access your Locker in an enemy-held building.
@xp_med_terminal_label=Medical Station
@xp_med_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Medical Station. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this station.
@xp_med_terminal_message=MEDICAL STATION\n\nThis medical station scans your matrix, looking for abnormalities. Nanites are then activated within your body while you're in the scanning field, and any Health defects are repaired.\n\nOnce you step into the Medical Station, you will automatically begin healing.\n\nYou can step out of the station at any time to interrupt this process.
@xp_order_terminal_label=Equipment Terminal
@xp_order_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Equipment Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_order_terminal_message=EQUIPMENT TERMINAL\n\nThis terminal allows access to Weapons, Armor, Equipment, Ammunition, and Favorites.\n\nAfter pressing the 'Use Key' to open the equipment interface, double-click on any item to automatically put it in your inventory.\n\nTo delete items from your inventory, select them and move them to the 'Destroy' button. To remove ALL items from your inventory, use the 'Clear Inventory' button.\n\nTo save your current inventory configuration, click the 'Favorites' button (on the far right) and double-click on an empty Favorite. This allows you to save your current config with a unique name so it can be retrieved quickly later.
@xp_respawn_terminal_label=Matrix Storage Panel
@xp_respawn_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Matrix Storage Panel. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this panel.
@xp_respawn_terminal_message=MATRIX STORAGE\n\nRecord your personal matrix here at this panel and you can respawn at this location, regardless of whether it is a 'nearest' facility or AMS.\n\nThis allows you different tactical options. For instance, you might manually bind at a Tech Plant across the continent and then decide to defend a friendly facility elsewhere on the continent so that you could respawn either at that defended facility (nearest bind) or at the tech plant (manual bind).
@xp_secondary_capture=Control Point
@xp_secondary_capture_label=Gun Tower Control Point
@xp_secondary_capture_descrip=You are facing the Gun Tower Control Point. You are awarded 50 BEP for visiting this point.
@xp_secondary_capture_message=GUN TOWER CONTROL POINT\n\nThis is the capture point for the Gun Tower.\n\nIn order to capture this facility for your Empire, equip a REK and hack this control point.\n\nThere is no capture period that occurs after hacking a control point. Once the hack is complete, the Gun Tower will switch ownership to your Empire immediately and all equipment herein can be used by your Empire.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_amp_label=Amp Station Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_amp_descrip=You are facing the Amp Station Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_amp_message=AMP LAB VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\nThe AMS, Sunderer, and Deliverer tactical vehicles can be created here.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_bio_label=Bio Lab Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_bio_descrip=You are facing the Bio Station Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_bio_message=BIO STATION VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\nThe Basilisk, Wraith, Harasser, and your Empire's heavy buggy can be created here.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_dc_label=Dropship Center Station Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_dc_descrip=You are facing the Dropship Center Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_dc_message=DROPSHIP CENTER VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\nThe Lightning, Harasser, and your Empire's heavy buggy can be created here. Each of these vehicles can be loaded into the back of a Galaxy Troop Transport.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_int_label=Interlink Facility Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_int_descrip=You are facing the Interlink Facility Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_int_message=INTERLINK FACILITY VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\nThe Lightning and your Empire's heavy tank can be created here.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_wall_turret_label=Defensive Wall Turret
@xp_wall_turret_descrip=You are facing a Defensive Wall Turret. You are awarded 100 BEP for investigating this turret.
@xp_wall_turret_message=DEFENSIVE WALL TURRET\n\nThese turrets can be either manned by soldiers, or left empty as an automated defense.\n\nTo man a turret, simply get into it. The controls are self-explanatory.\n\nTurrets are only automated if your Empire currently owns an Interlink Facility somewhere on this continent.\n\nIf no Interlink Facility is owned, then the turrets will NOT automatically fire on any targets.\n\nEven when an Interlink Facility is owned, turrets will only target enemy vehicles, unless Deployable Motion Sensors are placed to assist in detecting the smaller, humanoid movements.
@xp_warpgate_label=Warpgate
@xp_warpgate_descrip=You are inside a Warp Bubble. You are awarded 100 BEP for entering the warp gate area.
@xp_warpgate_message=WARP GATE\n\nYou are within the perimeter of a warp bubble.\n\nTo warp to another continent, move directly into the central column of light on top of the warp pad itself.\n\nIf you're on a Sanctuary, you are using a 'broadcast' warpgate that allows you to move to any other warpgate in the world.\n\nThe exception to 'any' warpgate is that you can't broadcast to locked continents or to enemy Sanctuaries.\n\nWhile you, or anyone else, is in the warp bubble, their matrix is shifted slightly between dimensions to avoid contact with other objects during phasing. Passing through other objects or vehicles will not harm you.\n\nYour weapons will not fire while dimensionally phased. They will return to normal when you exit the warp bubble.

# Weapon Help Messages
@xp_beamer_label=Beamer
@xp_beamer_descrip=You have equipped the Beamer energy pistol. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_beamer_message=BEAMER\n\nThe Beamer's main advantage lies in that it only uses a single ammunition source (the energy cell) and powers both its standard and armor piercing attacks from that same source, thus minimizing inventory space needed.\n\nThe armor-piercing shots use twice as much energy as the standard shots.\n\nBecause this is a pistol, the recoil on it is fairly severe. Thus for best accuracy, single shots or short bursts will result in the best accuracy.
@xp_bolt_driver_label=Bolt Driver
@xp_bolt_driver_descrip=You have equipped the Bolt Driver sniper rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_bolt_driver_message=BOLT DRIVER\n\nThe Bolt Driver uses a high-caliber "bolt" as its ammunition source and is a very powerful weapon.\n\nIts main drawback is that the reload time is quite slow, making it less useful in close quarters. When used in the field, in tandem with its 8X zoom, the rifle can be quite deadly.
@xp_chainblade_label=Chainblade
@xp_chainblade_descrip=You have equipped the Chainblade, the fall-back weapon of the Terran Republic. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_chainblade_message=CHAINBLADE\n\nThe primary attack of the chainblade is as a standard knife. The main advantage to this is that the attack is very quiet and can be used to stealthily dispose of wounded foes.\n\nThe secondary mode activates the chainblade around the edge of the knife. This attack is much more powerful, but is quite loud.
@xp_cycler_label=Cycler
@xp_cycler_descrip=You have equipped the Cycler assault rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_cycler_message=CYCLER\n\nThis rapid-firing rifle has an extended range over the Suppressor and a 4X zoom to help target with that extended range.\n\nEven with its increased rate of fire, the magazine's clip of 50 bullets is good for an extended exchange of fire.
@xp_flechette_label=Sweeper Shotgun
@xp_flechette_descrip=You have equipped the Sweeper shotgun. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_flechette_message=SWEEPER SHOTGUN\n\nThe power of the multiple slugs that are used in this weapon's burst allow surprising penetrating power.\n\nUseful against suits and lightly armored vehicles, the Sweeper shotgun is a backbone weapon for many ground assault forces across Auraxis.
@xp_forceblade_label=Forceblade
@xp_forceblade_descrip=You have equipped the Forceblade, the fall-back weapon of the Vanu Sovereignty. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_forceblade_message=FORCEBLADE\n\nThe primary attack of the forceblade is as a standard knife. The main advantage to this is that the attack is very quiet and can be used to stealthily dispose of wounded foes.\n\nThe secondary mode activates an energy field over the blade of the knife. This attack is much more powerful, but is quite bright and easily seen.
@xp_gauss_label=Gauss Rifle
@xp_gauss_descrip=You have equipped the Gauss Rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_gauss_message=GAUSS RIFLE\n\nThe magnetically accelerated round from this rifle has very high velocity and thus has very high penetrating power.
@xp_grenade_frag_label=Fragmentation Grenade
@xp_grenade_frag_descrip=You have equipped the Fragmentation Grenade. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_frag_message=FRAGMENTATION GRENADE\n\nThe Fragmentation (frag) grenade explodes, causing shrapnel damage to all within its area of effect.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy. (The VR Shooting Range is excellent for this type of practice.)
@xp_grenade_jammer_label=Jammer Grenade
@xp_grenade_jammer_descrip=You have equipped the Jammer Grenade. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_jammer_message=JAMMER GRENADE\n\nThe Jammer Grenade is used to deactivate lightly shielded electrical devices.\n\nThe Jammer will deactivate (temporarily) all Spitfire turrets and Motion Sensors in the area, as well as deactivating all implants on enemy soldiers within the area.\n\nAny implants thus deactivated have to 'reactivate' by letting their activation timer expire again, so this can be quite useful.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy. (The VR Shooting Range is excellent for this type of practice.)
@xp_grenade_plasma_label=Plasma Grenade
@xp_grenade_plasma_descrip=You have equipped the Plasma Grenade. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_plasma_message=PLASMA GRENADE\n\nSeething hot plasma covers your target and continues to burn for a short time after detonation. This causes continuous damage over time and tends to make enemies very unhappy.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy. (The VR Shooting Range is excellent for this type of practice.)
@xp_grenade_minesweeper_label=Minesweeper
@xp_grenade_minesweeper_descrip=You have equipped the Minesweeper. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_minesweeper_message=MINESWEEPER\n\nThe Minesweeper detonates all mines in the proximity of its own explosion. This allows you to clear a minefield with little danger.\n\nOf course, all those mines exploding is bound to attract enemies to see what happened to their mines, so watch out.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy.
@xp_hunterseeker_label=Phoenix Missile Launcher
@xp_hunterseeker_descrip=You have equipped the Phoenix missile launcher. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_hunterseeker_message=PHOENIX\n\nThis weapon is camera-guided. As soon as the missile is fired, your perspective will change to the view of the actual missile projectile and you will 'fly' your missile toward its target.\n\nThis takes some practice to refine, but if the operator of the weapon is skilled, this missile launcher is particularly accurate and devastating.\n\nThe missile's warhead may be detonated at any time by hitting the 'fire' key, thus allowing an operator to salvage a near-miss if detonated close enough to the target to cause damage anyway.
@xp_ilc9_label=AMP
@xp_ilc9_descrip=You have equipped the Automatic Machine Pistol (AMP). You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_ilc9_message=AUTOMATIC MACHINE PISTOL (AMP)\n\nBeware this weapon's rate of fire. Although superb for "suppressive" fire (inundating an area with projectiles), it is quite inaccurate beyond very short ranges unless fired in single shots or small bursts.
@xp_isp_label=MAG-Scatter Pistol
@xp_isp_descrip=You have equipped the MAG Scatter Pistol. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_isp_message=MAG-SCATTER PISTOL\n\nThis powerful magnetically-accelerated, hand-held pistol is, in reality, very similar to a shotgun with an extremely short barrel.\n\nIts projectiles spread out rapidly, but there are a great number of them. At close range, they do amazing damage, but as the shots spread out, they become more unlikely to hit what you were aiming at, and thus the weapon is less effective beyond a short range.
@xp_lancer_label=Lancer
@xp_lancer_descrip=You have equipped the Lancer beam rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_lancer_message=LANCER\n\nThis heavy beam rifle is particularly useful against vehicular targets (including MAXs). Although still potent against softer targets, the Lancer punches through armor spectacularly well.\n\nNote that after pulling the trigger, there is a half-second delay while the Lancer's internal capacitor charges then automatically releases the energy bolt.\n\nIf fired at a moving target, the Lancer must continue to be aimed at the target until the energy bolt fully charges and releases.
@xp_lasher_label=Lasher
@xp_lasher_descrip=You have equipped the Lasher heavy energy rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_lasher_message=LASHER\n\nThe Lasher's energy projectile is extremely slow, however, if it impacts a target, it does impressive damage.\n\nThe Lasher 'orb' also seeks nearby targets and lashes out energy tendrils toward that target, so that even a near-miss can still do damage.\n\nThis results in a particularly lethal weapon when used against squads in close formation. However, when firing the Lasher extra care must be employed as the ‘orb' cannot differentiate from friend or foe, and will lash out at any nearby target.
@xp_magcutter_label=MAG-cutter
@xp_magcutter_descrip=You have equipped the MAG-cutter, the fall-back weapon of the New Conglomerate. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_magcutter_message=MAG-CUTTER\n\nThe primary attack of the MAG-Cutter is as a standard knife. The main advantage to this is that the attack is very quiet and can be used to stealthily dispose of wounded foes.\n\nThe secondary mode activates a magnetic vibrating field around the blade. This attack is much more powerful, but the hum is quite distinctive and easily heard in the area it is used.
@xp_mini_chaingun_label=Mini-Chaingun
@xp_mini_chaingun_descrip=You have equipped the Mini-Chaingun. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_mini_chaingun_message=MINI-CHAINGUN\n\nThis weapon has a simple function. Unleash as many projectiles as possible, in as narrow a cone as possible, in the smallest amount of time possible.\n\nIt does this quite well.\n\nWith a reasonable range, and low recoil, the mini-chaingun can destroy infantry targets, or if AP ammo is used, is even effective against vehicles.\n\nThe mini-chaingun's sole drawback is that it chews through ammunition so quickly that it can be hard to keep it supplied when in anything except a Reinforced Exo-Suit.
@xp_phoenix_label=Decimator
@xp_phoenix_descrip=You have equipped the Decimator disposable missile launcher. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_phoenix_message=DECIMATOR\n\nThe warhead of this disposable missile launcher is extremely powerful, but the weapon is limited to only three shots before its built-in clip is depleted and the weapon must be discarded.\n\nOnce all shots are fired, the weapon is automatically dropped to clear your inventory for other items.\n\nThe projectile is dumb-fire, so you should lead your target carefully for best results.\n\nIf you want to get a closer view of your target, you can also fire this weapon in a secondary firing mode that allows a dumb-fire projectile with you attached in camera view. Use this tactically to spy out a remote position.
@xp_pulsar_label=Pulsar
@xp_pulsar_descrip=You have equipped the Pulsar heavy beam rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_pulsar_message=PULSAR\n\nThe Pulsar is essentially a rifle version of the Beamer pistol.  The Pulsar uses energy cells for fuel, and can switch between standard and armor-piercing effect by toggling between primary and secondary fire modes.\n\nThe weapon has a long firing range, 4X zoom, and is easy on the inventory. Many Vanu soldiers find it a reliable and useful weapon.
@xp_punisher_label=Punisher
@xp_punisher_descrip=You have equipped the Punisher assault rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_punisher_message=PUNISHER\n\nThe Swiss Army Knife of weaponry, the Punisher has two firing mechanisms.\n\nThe upper barrel is a rifle capable of switching between standard and armor-piercing ammunition.\n\nThe lower barrel is capable of firing either rocklet ammunition or lobbing grenades of three types: fragmentation, jammer, or plasma.\n\nThus, troops unsure of the type of engagement they are approaching often take the Punisher as a weapon.\n\nIts single drawback is that the rocklet/grenade barrel only has a magazine of one shot, so it's not as effective with those ammo types as more specialized weaponry.  However, the range on the Punisher, and its ability to 'panic fire' in tight situations, makes it a very popular weapon.
@xp_r_shotgun_label=Jackhammer
@xp_r_shotgun_descrip=You have equipped the Jackhammer rotary shotgun. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_r_shotgun_message=JACKHAMMER\n\nThe Jackhammer is a heavy assault shotgun with a unique secondary fire mode.\n\nWhen firing in secondary mode, all three barrels are fired in rapid succession, faster than would occur if you pulled the trigger normally. This results in incredible carnage in a short period of time.
@xp_repeater_label=Repeater
@xp_repeater_descrip=You have equipped the Repeater assault pistol. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_repeater_message=REPEATER\n\nThe standard sidearm of the Terran Republic, the Repeater has a large-caliber round, fired from an accurate barrel (for a pistol).\n\nThis results in good accuracy and hard hitting power, packaged into a smaller form than a rifle would take.
@xp_rocklet_label=Rocklet Rifle
@xp_rocklet_descrip=You have equipped the Rocklet projectile rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_rocklet_message=ROCKLET RIFLE\n\nThe Rocklet Rifle is a special assault weapon with a unique secondary fire mode.\n\nWhen fired in primary mode, a single rocket streaks forward, impacting in a small explosion.\n\nBut when firing in secondary mode, all shots remaining in the magazine are fired in rapid succession, faster than would occur if you pulled the trigger normally.  This results in incredible carnage in a short period of time.  However, its disadvantage is that the weapon must be fully reloaded before it is capable of firing again.
@xp_striker_label=Striker Missile Launcher
@xp_striker_descrip=You have equipped the Striker missile launcher. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_striker_message=STRIKER\n\nThe Striker is an anti-vehicular weapon.\n\nWhen the reticule is laid over an enemy vehicle, MAX, or turret, the Striker will attempt to lock onto that target.\n\nWhen lock is achieved, an audible tone will be heard, and the missile warhead will be guided to the target when fired.\n\nTo maintain lock on a target, the operator must hold the reticule over the target, even AFTER the warhead was fired. Failure to keep the reticule over the target will result in the warhead losing lock and becoming a dumb-fire, straight-line missile.\n\nThe Striker can intentionally be fired in dumb-fire mode by switching to its secondary firing mode.
@xp_suppressor_label=Suppressor Rifle
@xp_suppressor_descrip=You have equipped the Suppressor rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_suppressor_message=SUPPRESSOR\n\nThe Suppressor does reasonable damage and has a very minor recoil effect, thus resulting in extremely accurate fully-automatic fire.\n\nThe only potential drawback to this weapon is its light hitting power, but its rate of fire and tight accuracy often compensates for any disadvantages.
@xp_thumper_label=Thumper
@xp_thumper_descrip=You have equipped the Thumper grenade launcher rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_thumper_message=THUMPER\n\nThe Thumper is an extremely versatile grenade launcher since it can launch all three existing types of grenade ammo; fragmentation, jammer, and plasma.\n\nThus, if an operator keeps many grenade rounds in their inventory, the weapon can quickly be swapped to meet almost any situational need.  The presence of a Thumper expert on a squad should always be appreciated.

@xp_nc_hev_falcon_label=Falcon
@xp_nc_hev_falcon_descrip=You are equipped with the Falcon Rocket Launching System. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_nc_hev_falcon_message=FALCON\n\nThis powerful rocket launcher fires a dumb-fire projectile that streaks toward its target and delivers a massive payload.
@xp_nc_hev_scattercannon_label=Scattercannon
@xp_nc_hev_scattercannon_descrip=You are equipped with the Scattercannon. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_nc_hev_scattercannon_message=SCATTERCANNON\n\nThe Scattercannon is similar to an incredibly large bore shotgun, with adjustable-on-the-fly zoom views and shot patterns.\n\nEssentially, each of the firing modes is slightly more zoomed in and a tighter spread than the one before.\n\nThe first firing mode is close range and with a very large spread. This is designed for close-in dirty work against evasive targets.\n\nThe second mode is a more general-use setting with a longer range, but a tighter pattern, requiring more finesse when aiming.\n\nThe third mode is long range and has an extremely tight firing pattern, making it useful for long-range delivery of impressive damage.
@xp_nc_hev_sparrow_label=Sparrow
@xp_nc_hev_sparrow_descrip=You are equipped with the Sparrow Missile Launching System. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_nc_hev_sparrow_message=SPARROW\n\nThe Sparrow takes a second or two to lock onto a target, but once locked, the missiles in its payload can be fired rapidly until lock is broken.\n\nOnly air targets can be locked, but the Sparrow Missiles can be launched dumbfire, if desired. Without the lock, they will only impact the target kinetically, doing reduced damage without exploding, but they can be used versus ground vehicles and infantry in desparate situations.
@xp_trhev_burster_label=Burster
@xp_trhev_burster_descrip=You are equipped with the anti-aircraft Burster system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_trhev_burster_message=BURSTER\n\nThe Burster is often described as a potent, high-powered flak cannon.\n\nWhen operational, the Burster is constantly seeking air targets. Its shells are then programmed to detonate in near vicinity to that air target, thus allowing concentrated bursts of flak near the target. Repeated impacts from near-hits generally destroy the target.\n\nIf no air target is identified, the shells can still be fired. However, they will not explode at a pre-determined range and will impact inertially instead, for greatly reduced damage. However, this ability to fire without locking is quite handy when facing ground vehicles or infantry.\n\nTo greatly increase your rate-of-fire, anchor your suit. To move again after anchoring, you must un-anchor. This will restrict your field of fire, but you will be able to unleash a huge amount of ordnance that way.
@xp_trhev_dualcycler_label=Dual-Cycler
@xp_trhev_dualcycler_descrip=You are equipped with the Dual-Cycler anti-vehicular weapon system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_trhev_dualcycler_message=DUAL-CYCLER\n\nThese heavy chainguns fire simultaneously to fill a nearby area with a hail of lead projectiles.\n\nWhen the MAX is anchored, the rate-of-fire almost doubles, saturating an area in front of the MAX with high intensity firepower.\n\nThe depleted uranium ammunition used in the Dual-Cycler is best used against armored targets, but this much lead in the air isn't good for anything, so the MAX is multi-purpose.\n\nThe Dual-Cycler's chief drawback is its huge appetite for ammunition. Carry as much as you can. You'll need it.
@xp_trhev_pounder_label=Pounder
@xp_trhev_pounder_descrip=You are equipped with the anti-infantry Pounder grenade launching system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_trhev_pounder_message=POUNDER\n\nWhen anchored, the TR MAX can launch light mortars in a rapid fashion, innundating a target area with explosion after explosion.\n\nEven when not anchored, the mortars can be used to continuously barrage an area for suppression fire or just general destruction.\n\nCarry as much ammunition as you can. You'll need it.
@xp_vshev_comet_label=Comet
@xp_vshev_comet_descrip=Your are equipped with the anti-vehicular Comet plasma projector. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_vshev_comet_message=COMET\n\nThe Comet shoots energy spheres of roiling plasma in a straight-line toward your target.\n\nWhen those spheres impact a surface, they detonate fiercely, causing explosive damage in that area.
@xp_vshev_quasar_label=Quasar
@xp_vshev_quasar_descrip=You are equipped with the Quasar anti-infantry weapon system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_vshev_quasar_message=QUASAR\n\nThe Quasar is a souped-up, more powerful version of the Pulsar hand-held rifle.\n\nLike most Vanu beam weapons, the Quasar can fire in both standard and armor-piercing modes and it does tremendous damage against most targets.\n\nAlthough still not as powerful against vehicles as the Comet configuration, the Quasar makes mincemeat of most infantry opponents.
@xp_vshev_starfire_label=Starfire
@xp_vshev_starfire_descrip=You are equipped with the Starfire anti-aircraft energy weapon. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_vshev_starfire_message=STARFIRE\n\nWhen targeting aircraft, the Starfire can achieve a weapons lock.\n\nOnce lock is achieved, the plasma spheres launched by the Starfire will guide in on that target, impacting it and splashing it with aggravated damage (the plasma burns over time, destroying the target rapidly as it burns).\n\nIf no target lock is achieved, the Starfire plasma can be fired, but it will not explode on impact without a lock and does significantly less damage. However, this 'dumb-fire' mode can be very useful against ground vehicles and infantry in a desparate situation.

@xp_105mm_cannon_label=100mm Cannon
@xp_105mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 100mm Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_105mm_cannon_message=100mm CANNON\n\nThis medium tank cannon lacks the power of the 150 mm Cannon, but enjoys a faster refire rate and moderate recoil penalties.
@xp_150mm_cannon_label=150mm Cannon
@xp_150mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 150mm Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_150mm_cannon_message=150mm CANNON\n\nThe most powerful anti-vehicular cannon on a per shot basis, the 150 mm Cannon combines devastating power, proximity damage, and long range capabilities to make it an ideal anti-tank weapon.\n\nThe 150mm does suffer from a poor refire rate, but is nonetheless the king of vehicular cannons.
@xp_20mm_cannon_label=20mm Recoilless Chaingun
@xp_20mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 20mm Recoilless Chaingun. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_20mm_cannon_message=20mm RECOILLESS CHAINGUN\n\nWhile this weapon doesn't have the blazing refire rate of the Rotary Chaingun, it nonetheless makes up for it with increased damage per shot and improved accuracy.\n\nThe 20 mm Recoilless Chaingun can be used effectively against infantry as well as lightly armored vehicles, even over long range.
@xp_75mm_cannon_label=75mm Cannon
@xp_75mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 75mm Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_75mm_cannon_message=75mm CANNON\n\nThe 75mm launches explosive shells that inflict moderate damage against vehicles and high damage against infantry.\n\nA reasonable refire rate gives the 75mm a somewhat balanced role as both anti-vehicular and anti-infantry.\n\nEach shell is explosive and causes damage to all targets within a small area.
@xp_firebird_label=Firebird Rocket Launcher
@xp_firebird_descrip=You are manning the Firebird Advanced Rocket Launching (ARL) System. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_firebird_message=FIREBIRD ROCKET LAUNCHER\n\nLaunching potent rockets at a fairly rapid rate, the Firebird is extremely useful when mounted on mobile armor.\n\nThe refire rate is average, but each rocket delivers both solid damage and a reasonable proximity effect when exploding.\n\nThe projectiles travel at a fairly swift rate when launched, but are best used against close- to medium-range vehicular targets. Targets at longer ranges can generally undertake evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit by a Firebird rocket.
@xp_flux_cannon_label=Flux Cannon
@xp_flux_cannon_descrip=You are manning the Flux Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_flux_cannon_message=FLUX CANNON\n\nConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies.\n\nWhile an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate.\n\nWhen fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@xp_heavy_grenade_launcher_label=GroundPounder
@xp_heavy_grenade_launcher_descrip=You are manning the GroundPounder. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_heavy_grenade_launcher_message=GROUNDPOUNDER\n\nThe GroundPounder inflicts most of its damage through proximity radius.\n\nWhen fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases in a linear manner to the proximity's edge.\n\nDue to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@xp_heavy_rail_beam_label=Heavy Rail Beam
@xp_heavy_rail_beam_descrip=You are manning the Heavy Rail Beam. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_heavy_rail_beam_message=HEAVY RAIL BEAM\n\nExtremely precise and powerful, the Heavy Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects.\n\nThe Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@xp_lightning_weapons_label=Lightning Weapons Systems
@xp_lightning_weapons_descrip=You are driving the Lightning and have access to its weapon systems.
@xp_lightning_weapons_message=LIGHTNING WEAPON SYSTEMS\n\nThe Lightning carries both a 75mm Cannon and 12mm Rotary Chaingun for the driver to use.\n\nThe cannon is best used for vehicular and MAX targets, while the chaingun is best for mowing down infantry targets.
@xp_phalanx_label=Phalanx Wall Turret
@xp_phalanx_descrip=You are operating a wall turret. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_phalanx_message=PHALANX WALL TURRET\n\nThe wall turrets employ a Phalanx chaingun system.\n\nWith ammunition supplied from below the turret within the wall, the turret has virtually endless ammunition and is extremely effective against incoming invaders.
@xp_pulsed_particle_accelerator_label=Pulsed Particle Accelerator
@xp_pulsed_particle_accelerator_descrip=You are manning the Pulsed Particle Accelerator.
@xp_pulsed_particle_accelerator_message=PULSED PARTICLE ACCELERATOR\n\nDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially a laser machine gun.\n\nThe individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic.\n\nThe pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they begin to dissipate.\n\nAs with the Rotary Chaingun and 20mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@xp_reaver_weapons_label=Reaver Weapon Systems
@xp_reaver_weapons_descrip=You are piloting the Reaver and have access to its weapon systems. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_reaver_weapons_message=REAVER WEAPONS SYSTEMS\n\nThe Reaver gunship has both a 20mm Recoilless Chaingun and Rocket Launchers beneath its wings.\n\nThe rockets are best used versus vehicular and MAX targets, while the chaingun is better for softer infantry targets.
@xp_rotarychaingun_label=12mm Rotary Chaingun
@xp_rotarychaingun_descrip=You have access to the 12mm Rotary Chaingun You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_rotarychaingun_message=12mm ROTARY CHAINGUN\n\nYour forward-firing weapon is the 12mm Rotary Chaingun.\n\nIt is useful against infantry targets and some light armor.\n\nIt consumes ammunition at a fairly rapid rate, so it's wise to stock extra ammo in the trunk so that you can reload in the field.
@xp_vanguard_weapons_label=Vanguard Weapons Systems
@xp_vanguard_weapons_descrip=You are manning the gunnery position on a Vanguard heavy tank. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_vanguard_weapons_message=VANGUARD WEAPON SYSTEMS\n\nThe Vanguard heavy tank has two weapons available from its gunnery position.\n\nThe gunner can cycle between a 20mm Recoilless Chaingun and a 150mm Cannon.\n\nThe 150mm Cannon is the largest weapon available on the battlefield and makes short work of almost anything it hits, but the chaingun still has its uses against faster-moving targets and for suppression fire.

# Vehicle Help Messages
@xp_ams_label=Advanced Mobile Station
@xp_ams_descrip=You are facing an Advanced Mobile Station (AMS). You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_ams_message=ADVANCED MOBILE STATION (AMS)\n\nTo deploy an AMS in the field, first bring the vehicle to a complete stop, then go to the front of the vehicle, on the 'deploy' mount circle, and hit the Use Key.\n\nThis will deploy the respawn tubes and equipment terminal for action.\n\nTo make the AMS mobile again, you must first un-deploy the vehicle. This is done by the same process as deploying the vehicle in the first place.\n\nNote also that anyone who binds to the respawn tubes on the AMS will be unable to respawn there if the vehicle is in motion. The vehicle must be deployed in order for the respawn tubes to function.
@xp_ant_label=Advanced Nanite Transport
@xp_ant_descrip=You are facing an Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT). You are awarded 50 BEP for investigating this vehicle for the first time.
@xp_ant_message=ADVANCED NANITE TRANSPORT (ANT)\n\nThe ANT is used to gather energy resources from warp gate bubbles and bring those resources to battle facilities for use as power.\n\nTo gather energy, the ANT is driven within a warp gate bubble. Once there, it deploys its collector vanes and gathers the ancient Vanu nanite energy replicators.\n\nThat cargo of nanites is then driven to a base facility and the ANT is deployed near the base's Silo.\n\nThe nanites are then transmitted to the base facility on a carrier beam.\n\nOnce inside the Silo, the nanites begin their work of replicating energy for use by the facility, but the human tech interface (Silo) is imperfect and doesn't seem to sustain the nanites for some reason, so they eventually perish and have to be replenished for the Silos to be effective.
@xp_apc_label=Sunderer
@xp_apc_descrip=You are facing the Sunderer large ground transport vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_apc_message=SUNDERER\n\nThe Sunderer can carry a driver, two MAXs, six passengers, and two gunners.\n\nThis allows the flexibility for a driver to ferry a full squad of passengers to a destination, if desired.\n\nThe two guns on the Sunderer are 75mm Cannons which do heavy damage against vehicles, and moderate damage against infantry.
@xp_dropship_label=Galaxy
@xp_dropship_descrip=You are facing the Galaxy large transport aircraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_dropship_message=GALAXY\n\nThe Galaxy aircraft can carry a pilot, two MAXs, six passengers, two wing gunners, a tailgunner, and a light assault vehicle with up to three passengers, bringing the maximum total personnel carried up to 15 people.\n\nThis is plenty of room for a regular flight crew (pilot and three gunners), and a full squad as passengers.\n\nVehicles that can be carried include: Harasser, Lightning, Thresher(VS), Enforcer(NC), Marauder(TR), Wraith, Basilisk, and ANT.
@xp_lightgunship_label=Reaver
@xp_lightgunship_descrip=You are facing the Reaver armored attack aircraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_lightgunship_message=REAVER\n\nThis aircraft is more heavily armored and armed than it's scout-cousin, the Mosquito.\n\nThis armor and weaponry comes at the price of agility and speed, as well as the fact that enemy radar easily picks up the Reaver as a target.\n\nHowever, the Reaver carries both the 20mm chaingun and twin Rocket Launchers.\n\nThese pods can deliver catastrophic damage to vehicles, while the machine gun is best used against softer targets.\n\nThe Reaver also sports an afterburner that affords it temporary surges in forward velocity.\n\nThe afterburner draws on a specially integrated capacitor, which slowly recharges each time the afterburner is used.
@xp_lightning_label=Lightning
@xp_lightning_descrip=You are facing the Lightning light armor assault vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_lightning_message=LIGHTNING\n\nThe Lightning's best asset is its mobility. The vehicle is lightly armored and must keep moving to avoid the damage potential of other, heavier vehicles on the battlefield.\n\nThe lightning carries two weapons; the 12mm rotary chaingun, and the 75mm anti-vehicle cannon.\n\nBoth weapons are mounted on forward-swiveling, driver-controlled turrets for ease of use while driving.
@xp_magrider_label=Magrider
@xp_magrider_descrip=You are facing the Magrider heavy armor assault hovercraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_magrider_message=MAGRIDER\n\nThe Magrider is large and slow, but heavily armored and with lateral maneuverability that non-hovercraft can't match.\n\nThe tank carries both the Heavy Rail Beam and the Particle Beam Cannon.\n\nThe Heavy Rail Beam can rapidly decimate infantry targets with its energy beam, while the Particle Beam Cannon carries the punching power to penetrate even heavy armor on enemy hard targets.\n\nWith its hover technology, the Magrider can also cross small waterways, smoothly gliding over the surface.\n\nHowever, in doing so, the Magrider stabilizes itself with air jets that automatically engage over water and has a decreased top speed.\n\nThe air jets have limited capacity, and if depleted the Magrider will literally sink into the water.\n\nFortunately when back over land the air jet capacitor will slowly recharge.
@xp_mediumtransport_label=Deliverer
@xp_mediumtransport_descrip=You are facing the Deliverer transport vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_mediumtransport_message=DELIVERER\n\nThe Deliverer is designed to deliver half a squad to a destination with rapid speed and mobility.\n\nIt is more lightly armored and armed than its behemoth cousin, the Sunderer.\n\nIt has two weapon mounts equipped with 20mm chainguns to repel infantry attacks, but should avoid engagements with heavy armor as neither its weapons nor its armor are up to that task.\n\nThe Deliverer is also an amphibious vehicle, capable of crossing waterways.\n\nWhen in water, the Deliverer suffers from extreme drag, still using its wheels for propulsion, and is only capable of achieving a small measure of its top speed.\n\nThis makes the Deliverer quite vulnerable when crossing water, although the amphibious benefit can often be invaluable for travel in general.
@xp_mosquito_label=Mosquito
@xp_mosquito_descrip=You are facing a Mosquito scouting aircraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_mosquito_message=MOSQUITO\n\nThe Mosquito's primary advantages are its stealth capability (it is very difficult to see a Mosquito on radar), its speed and agility, as well as its overflight ability that lets objects it overflies appear on radar so that squadmates can gather intelligence information.\n\nThe Mosquito is equipped with a 12mm rotary chaingun, but should only use it for anti-air engagements, or for light strafing on infantry targets.
@xp_prowler_label=Prowler

@xp_prowler_message=PROWLER\n\nThis is the heaviest tank in the Terran Republic arsenal. A three-man crew drives the tank and mans the weapon platforms.\n\nThe 100mm cannon has high penetrating power against hard targets, while the dual 12mm Rotary Chaingun can make quick work of lightly armored and unarmored targets.
@xp_quadassault_label=Basilisk
@xp_quadassault_descrip=You are facing the Basilisk light scout vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_quadassault_message=BASILISK\n\nThe Basilisk is a great vehicle for going from Point A to Point B as rapidly as possible. It even has a light, forward-sweeping 12mm rotary chaingun for its driver to use.\n\nHowever, the open structure of the Basilisk, combined with its almost complete lack of armor, makes it a poor choice to ride when entering a contested battlefield.\n\nPlease note, however, that its small profile allows it to avoid being shot by automated wall turret systems. It's not visible on their sensors unless motion sensors are nearby.
@xp_quadstealth_label=Wraith
@xp_quadstealth_descrip=You are facing the Wraith light stealth vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_quadstealth_message=WRAITH\n\nThis is the cloaking version of the Basilisk.\n\nWhen a rider wearing an Infiltration Suit is riding the Wraith, the on-board systems can be plugged into the rider's suit to enable the vehicle and suit to cloak together at the same time. Of course, like regular Infilitration Suit cloaking, the faster the vehicle moves, the lower the effectiveness of the vehicle's cloak.\n\nCurrently, weapon systems have caused too much interference with the Wraith's cloaking engine, so no weapons are mounted to the Wraith.\n\nPlease note, however, that its small profile allows it to avoid being shot by automated wall turret systems. It's not visible on their sensors unless motion sensors are nearby.

@xp_threemanheavybuggy_message=MARAUDER\n\nThis three-man buggy has more armor, and two mounted weapons for gunners to operate.\n\nHighly mobile, but still not heavy enough to qualify as a tank, the Marauder can still do a serious amount of damage on the battlefield.\n\nThe 12mm Chaingun, used from the side passenger seat, as well as the GroundPounder Launcher mounted in the rear turret of the vehicle, make this buggy lethal against both infantry and hard targets up to lightly armored tanks.
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_label=Harasser
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_descrip=You are facing the Harasser light armor scout vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_message=HARASSER\n\nThe Harasser is a light harrying vehicle designed for rapid transit, as well as hit-and-run assaults designed to keep the enemy off-balance.\n\nThe two-man buggy carries a 12mm rotary chaingun in the gunner seat for use against soft targets, while the driver concentrates on keeping this lightly armored vehicle operational.\n\nThe Harasser's low profile and light armor just manages to avoid making it dense enough for wall turret scanners. Therefore, unless detected by a Motion Sensor, the Harasser will not be fired upon by Phalanx Wall Turrets.
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_label=Enforcer
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_descrip=You are facing the Enforcer light armor support vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_message=ENFORCER\n\nThis lightly armored buggy sports a Firebird advanced rocket launcher system in a rear turret, making it a powerful opponent to heavy armor.\n\nWhile it can't take a punch well, it's light profile and weight make it a difficult target for heavy ordnance to home in upon and make this vehicle something that tank commanders fear.
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_label=Thresher
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_descrip=You are facing the Thresher light armor scout hovercraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_message=THRESHER\n\nThis light hovercraft has a Flux Cannon mounted in the passenger position for use against infantry and light armor.\n\nThe hovercraft abilities allow this vehicle to travel for short periods over water, as well as allowing it to strafe left and right across open terrain, thus making it extremely maneuverable.\n\nWhen crossing water, the Thresher stabilizes itself with air jets that automatically engage over water and has a decreased top speed.\n\nThe air jets have limited capacity, and if depleted the Thresher will literally sink into the water.\n\nFortunately when back over land the air jet capacitor will slowly recharge.

@xp_command_uplink_message=COMMAND UPLINK\n\nThe Command Uplink device is a DNA-encoded communication device allowing a field commander to speak directly with the Command and Control team in the Empire's Orbital Platform.\n\nBy using the Uplink a Commander can get updates every 20 minutes or so regarding the position of all friendlies on a continent (at Command Rank 2), and the positions of enemies in the area (starting at Command Rank 3 and increasing in detection radius up to CR 5).\n\nAdditionally, the Uplink can act as a localized jamming device, preventing other Commanders from seeing troops around him for a brief blackout period, thus avoiding detection by enemy Commanders (the area of this jamming increases with rank, beginning at CR3).\n\nLast, but not least, high-ranked Commanders (CR4 and 5) have the ability to use an Orbital Strike. By lazing the target area (using the Uplink device), the Commander designates a target that is then blasted from Orbit. CR5 commanders can command larger Orbital Strikes than CR4 Commanders.
@xp_med_app_label=Medical Applicator
@xp_med_app_descrip=You have equipped the Medical Applicator.  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_med_app_message=MEDICAL APPLICATOR\n\nThe Medical Applicator is tied tightly into the Vanu respawning technology.\n\nThis hand-held device is an energy projector (like the BANK) that stimulates nanites within the flesh of soldiers, but also communicates (via human tech interfaces) with the Vanu tech at the core of the planet.\n\nThus, the med applicator can restore the matrix of the living tissue of a soldier, as well as actually revive the lifespark within a recently dead soldier.\n\nThere are two firing modes for the med applicator. Primary firing heals and revives other soldiers, while the secondary mode can heal yourself.\n\n To successfully revive a fallen comrade, you must use the med applicator on them BEFORE they release to go back to a respawn point.\n\nIn otherwords, if you see a friendly corpse on the ground, you can revive the slain soldier. If you see nothing but a loot box, then it's too late and they've already released for respawn.
@xp_nano_dispenser_label=Nano-Dispenser
@xp_nano_dispenser_descrip=You have equipped the Nano-Dispenser.  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_nano_dispenser_message=NANO-DISPENSER\n\nThe Nano-Dispenser assesses a target in need of repair, configures nanites to work on that target, and then projects a beam on which the nanites travel to the target. The excited energy beam provides a power source for those nanites, allowing them to repair almost any static object or vehicle until the power beam is stopped.\n\nThe nano-dispenser can be used to repair the armor of all vehicles, equipment terminals, and deployable objects.\n\nTo repair an object, merely point the nano-dispenser at that target and press the fire key.
@xp_rek_label=Remote Electronics Kit (REK)
@xp_rek_descrip=You have equipped the Remote Electronics Kit (REK).  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_rek_message=REMOTE ELECTRONICS KIT (REK)\n\nThe Remote Electronics Kit (REK) is a hand-held hacking device that interfaces withenemy terminals at close range. Most REK functions require either Hacking or Advanced Hacking certifications, but there are also standard functions that don't require any hacking certifications such as hacking enemy door IFFs and control consoles.\n\nSoldiers with a Hacking certification can hack enemy terminals for use by friendly troops, including equipment terminals, vehicle terminals, implant terminals and more. They also hack doors and control consoles faster than soldiers without a Hacking certification.\n\nAn Advanced Hacker does everything a Hacker can do, but does it at very fast speeds, thus minimizing risk to the hacker.\n\nHackers and Advanced Hackers can also 'jack' enemy vehicles, switching them from the enemy empire's control to your own.

@xp_map01_message=SOLSAR\n\nThe large central oasis of Solsar is flanked by two warp gates on plateaus nearby, making it a unique tactical situation.\n\nThere are relatively few roads and very rough off-road terrain here, making the bases more defensible to standard massed armor attacks.
@xp_map02_label=Visit Hossin
@xp_map02_descrip=You have arrived at Hossin. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map02_message=HOSSIN\n\nHossin is a lush, temperate continent covered in low, rolling hills. Swamps also dot the terrain and can lure the unsuspecting traveller with illusions of an easy shortcut.\n\nThe continent is divided by a river in the center which splits and surrounds an island on its way through the continent.
@xp_map03_label=Visit Cyssor
@xp_map03_descrip=You have arrived at Cyssor. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map03_message=CYSSOR\n\nThe quakes that still rattle Cyssor shook this continent until it broke and the pieces that remain look more like islands than an intact continent.\n\nBridges span the many waterways on this island continent and it still has the tallest mountain on the planet.\n\nWily commanders will recognize the many traffic flow bottlenecks and the centrally located Dropship Center in the middle of Cyssor.
@xp_map04_label=Visit Ishundar
@xp_map04_descrip=You have arrived at Ishundar. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map04_message=ISHUNDAR\n\nThis continent is extremely arid and inhospitable to life. Its salt-water lakes are the only break in the unending bleakness that is Ishundar.\n\nThe continent is split in two by a gigantic canyon valley between the two highlands in Ishundar's center, making traffic flows between the two halves more predictable and creating bottlenecks for tacticians to exploit.

@xp_map05_descrip=You have arrived at Forseral. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map05_message=FORSERAL\n\nThis sprawling continent is temperate in nature. Lakes dot the map, and peaks jut up into the sky. Easy cover for infantry is found in groves of trees and ravines, while vehicles need to watch for ambushes from those same places.
@xp_map06_label=Visit Ceryshen
@xp_map06_descrip=You have arrived at Ceryshen. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map06_message=CERYSHEN\n\nThe permafrost terrain on this continent is extremely vertical. Cliffs abound, and a misplaced footstep can send you hurtling to your doom. Air vehicles can cross this terrain quickly, but foot soldiers and ground vehicles find that many miles lay between point A and point B due to successive switchbacks and roundabout roads.
@xp_map07_label=Visit Esamir
@xp_map07_descrip=You have arrived at Esamir. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map07_message=ESAMIR\n\nThe dense snow-covered forests, low visibility and rolling hills make this continent difficult for off-road vehicles and makes infantry tactics more common than massed armor.\n\nEsamir is the largest of the island continents on Auraxis.
@xp_map08_label=Visit Oshur
@xp_map08_descrip=You have arrived at Oshur. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map08_message=OSHUR\n\nThis extremely rough desert continent consists of the broken bones of an impact crater. The rough badlands and choppy terrain make it relatively easy to hide fairly large forces in what seems to be plain view.\n\nA giant, unexplained avian skeleton lies fossilized on the continent, giving rise to lively discussions about the Vanu that were here before.
@xp_map09_label=Visit Searhus
@xp_map09_descrip=You have arrived at Searhus. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map09_message=SEARHUS\n\nThe center of this continent is a gigantic volcanic caldera. The bases inside that crater are an obvious stronghold on the continent, but to keep those bases secure, the facilities on the rim of the caldera should be secured as well. Beware the lava pools! They are extremely unforgiving.
@xp_map10_label=Visit Amerish
@xp_map10_descrip=You have arrived at Amerish. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map10_message=AMERISH\n\nThe battle bases on Amerish are loosely grouped into two clusters, north and south.\n\nAlthough spaced unevenly, there are definitely choke points and assault paths that can be anticipated for tactical use.\n\nHowever, the four small islands off the coasts can be used for alternate paths, making for elements of unpredictability and ambush.

This island is secured from enemy invasion by the encrypted warpgates connecting it to other continents.\n\nUnlike the more general warpgates elsewhere in the world, the secure gates only respond to the identichip embedded in your skull, thus only allowing members of your Empire to pass into this Sanctuary.\n\nThe Sanctuary has everything you need to launch a full-scale campaign against your Empire's enemies. Ground vehicles, air vehicles, the giant Galaxy dropships, armor, weapons, equipment, implants, and even training terminals are all available here in the Sanctuary complex.\n\nWander about. Look for the floating Auraxis icon over the terminals...those icons are indicators of something you haven't seen before, and they'll give you information if you get close to them and look at them.\n\nWhen you are fully outfitted, take a moment to talk to other soldiers here. Join or form a squad. And when you're ready, you can either take one of the HART shuttles and drop pod down to the planet somewhere, or you can grab vehicles and head to one of the three Warp Gates in the area to jump to other continents.\n\nBe sure to use your overhead map function to navigate around. It will help you keep your bearings.

@xp_bind_ams_message=MANUAL BIND AT AMS\n\nNow that your matrix is bound at this vehicle, you may choose to respawn here after you've been killed.\n\nTo respawn at this vehicle, merely choose the option to respawn at your AMS bind when you die.

@xp_bind_facility_descrip=You have bound your matrix to a facility for the first time. You are awarded 200 BEP.
@xp_bind_facility_message=MANUAL BIND AT FACILITY\n\nNow that your matrix is bound at this facility, you may choose to respawn here after you've been killed.\n\nWhen you die, you'll get the choice to either respawn at your Sanctuary, the nearest friendly facility on that continent, a manual bind you made at a battle facility, or a manual bind you made at an AMS vehicle.\n\nThus, if you're careful, you can manage your respawn locations carefully and tactically. 
@xp_form_squad_label=Form a Squad
@xp_form_squad_descrip=You have formed a squad and are now that squad's commander. You are awarded 200 Command Experience Points (CEP).
@xp_form_squad_message=YOU FORMED A SQUAD\n\nAs the commander of your new squad, you now have the ability to add and kick members from the squad.\n\nTo gain CEP for a facility capture, your squad or platoon must fight within an SOI and kill enemy soldiers during the 15-minute hack. Experience gained is directly proportional to the number of UNIQUE plaeyrs that you kill in that SOI, so its easier to get BEP or CEP in hotly contested areas. (Whereas uncontested caps will result in zero BEP/CEP.)\n\nNOTE: Commanders have their CEP awards scaled according to the size of their squad. Two players in a squad get 10% of max xp for a cap. Squads with eight or more members get 100% of max xp. It scales in between those end points.\n\n Command Experence is the only way for you to gain command rank, so don't forget this very important fact.

@xp_orbital_shuttle_descrip=You have boarded the HART Shuttle for the first time. You are awarded 200 BEP.
@xp_orbital_shuttle_message=HART SHUTTLE\n\nThe HART Shuttle will now prep for launch.\n\nAfter the shuttle launches, it ascends high into the stratosphere and positions itself for your drop mission.\n\nAt that time, you'll designate your drop zone by using the map interface.\n\nOnce you hit the drop button, the shuttle will release your pod and you'll streak down through the sky to land, hopefully in one piece, near your desired drop point.\n\nBeware of drop pod hunters! There are roving bands of enemies that look for the telltale contrails of drop pods descending from the clouds. To avoid them, try dropping a bit farther out from a facility than you might otherwise desire.
@xp_warp_gate_label=Use Broadcast Warpgate
@xp_warp_gate_descrip=You have used a 'broadcast' warpgate for the first time to go from your Empire's Sanctuary to another continent. You are awarded 200 BEP.
@xp_warp_gate_message=BROADCAST WARPGATES\n\nMost warpgates are locked so they go from one specific warpgate to another.\n\nThe warpgates in your Sanctuary are different. They can be used to transport to ANY warpgate in the world, *except* for warpgates on locked continents or warpgates on Enemy Sanctuaries.\n\nOnce you've entered a broadcast warpgate, the global map comes up. Double-click a destination continent so that it zooms to continent view.\n\nThen just click on any of the blinking warpgate icons to select a destination.\n\nYou'll immediately warp there.

@xp_instant_action_message=INSTANT ACTION\n\nYou are seeing this message because you just selected 'Instant Action' from the Character Creation screens or you just chose 'Request Deployment' from the ESCAPE menu.\n\nYou have just been transported to a 'hot spot' somewhere in the world. You're currently in the basement of a friendly facility, but a battle is raging nearby.\n\nTo find the battle, hit 'M' to open your map screen and look for the nearby flashing Hot Spot indicator.\n\nNote the compass direction to that battle and then head on over there. Once you find the battle, you'll be able to figure out who is involved and what sort of fight is occurring. Enjoy!

@xp_drop_pod_label=Using a Drop Pod
@xp_drop_pod_descrip=You are using an Orbital Drop Pod for the first time.
@xp_drop_pod_message=USING A DROP POD\n\nNow that you've entered a Drop Pod, you need to select your Drop Zone so you can launch from the HART and land on your chosen continent.\n\nTo select a Drop Zone, first double-click on one of the continents you see on the Global Map.\n\nThis takes you to the Continent View for that continent.\n\nJust single-click anywhere on the map to indicate a Drop Zone and then click the DROP button in the lower, right of the screen. You'll immediately launch after you click that button.\n\nThere is no way to leave the HART shuttle other than to drop to the surface below, so suck it up soldier and DROP!

@xp_overhead_map_label=Using the World Map
@xp_overhead_map_descrip=You are using the World Map for the first time.
@xp_overhead_map_message=USING THE WORLD MAP\n\nThe World Map is your key to situational awareness around the planet of Auraxis.\n\nThe Global view shows you all 10 continents (plus the three Sanctuaries). On each continent, you'll see blinking starbursts that indicate large battles occurring on those continents. Go there if you want to head directly into action.\n\nThere is a Legend on the screen showing you what each of the map symbols mean, as well as two toolbars you can use to manipulate the map.\n\nThe Map Toolbar lets you easily switch between Global and Continent views, lets you zoom in and out (you can also use mouse wheel to zoom), and lets you set waypoints.\n\nThe other toolbar, the 'Toggle Visible' bar, lets you toggle on/off the various informational overlays on the map.\n\nExperiment with this interface for a bit. It's very powerful and the more you know about how to use it, the better you'll do during battle.

# MAIN HELP
#--------------------------
@HelpTitle=PlanetSide Help
@HelpHelp=Help on Help
@HelpHelpText=This help system is available to answer common questions about PlanetSide...both its user interface and game mechanics.\n\nBrowse through the topics below and click on each heading to see sub-topics that may interest you.
@HelpHelpItem=Index
@HelpHelpItemText=The list on the left is the index of available help topics.Click on a header to selct it and open its sub-topics list.
@HelpHelpContext=Context
@HelpHelpContextText=The '?' on many user interface items will bring you to the appropriate help topic for that window, thus making it easier to find focused help about an issue when you have questions.
@HelpArmor=Armor
@HelpArmorText=There are many types of armor for you to choose from on the battlefield. A brief synopsis of their differences is described here.
@HelpImplants=Implants
@HelpImplantsText=*** Implants ***
@HelpFrontend=Starting Screens
@HelpFrontendText=The 'Starting Screens' are the screens used to select your Empire, create your characters and select your characters for entry into a world. The Server Select screen is also described here.
@HelpFrontendServer=Server Select
@HelpFrontendServerText=This window lists the available Worlds you can choose.\n\nSelect a World and hit the NEXT button in the lower, right of the screen in order to connect to that World and begin a career in PlanetSide.\n\nYou can sort any of the columns by left-clicking the column's name. That way you can easily find which server has the best ping, most players, or which Empire needs players.\n\nThe 'Empire Needs' column shows you if one of the three Empires needs more characters on that particular server to balance the world. You will usually receive incentives (bonuses) for joining an underdog Empire.
@HelpFrontendEmpire=Empire Select
@HelpFrontendEmpireText=The war rages between three different Empires; the Terran Republic, the New Conglomerate, and the Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nRead more about them by clicking on their respective logo buttons in the center of the screen.\n\nNOTE: You can only create characters from a single empire on any particular world server.\n\nOnce you choose an Empire, that's your choice on that given world unless you first delete all your characters from your current empire on this world server.\n\nTo select an Empire, click it, and then press the NEXT button in the lower, right of the screen.
@HelpFrontendCharacter=Character Select
@HelpFrontendCharacterText=The soldiers you have created for the selected World are available on this screen. Select one by clicking on that soldier's name.\n\nTo enter the world and begin play click the NEXT button in the lower right of the screen.\n\nTo delete the character, click the delete circle under the bottom character slot.
@HelpFrontendCreate=Character Creation
@HelpFrontendCreateText=You create your soldiers here.\n\nEnter your soldier's name in the space provided at the top of the screen.\n\nThen select a gender (male/female) by clicking the appropriate gender button.\n\nSelect a face by scrolling through the available faces, and then pick a voice for your soldier by clicking and listening to the various voice sets avialable.\n\nWhen you have all your choices made, click the right arrow in the lower, right of the screen in order to save the soldier and enter the world.
@HelpFrontendInstantAction=Starting Locations
@HelpFrontendInstantActionText=You have two choices as a beginning character. You can first appear in your Empire's Sanctuary, where you can use a HART shuttle to drop pod through the atmosphere, or travel to a warpgate and a continent that connects to your Sanctuary. Or you can choose Instant Action. When you choose Instant Action, you are voluntarily deconstructing your soldier and allowing your Empire to determine where you would be best used to advance their causes.\n\nWhen this happens, you will be reconstructed in a facility or tower near to a "hot spot" on the continent.\n\nThat hotspot is easily seen. Your personal waypoint is placed on that hotspot upon your arrival, so you can find the battle you've been directed toward by just heading to the waypoint.\n\nThere are no guarantees what part of the world Instant Action will take you to...that's all dependent upon where the major battles are on Auraxis.
@HelpOfflineTraining=Offline Training
@HelpOfflineTrainingText=The offline training will guide you through learning about many of the aspects of PlanetSide.\n\nThe missions include "BASIC MOVEMENT AND WEAPON HANDLING", "CERTIFICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT", "VEHICLE HANDLING", "MAP USAGE", "DROP PODS", "CAPTURING FACILITES", "SILOS AND THE ANT", and "DYING AND RESPAWNING"
@HelpOfflineMissionSelectHelp=Mission Select
@HelpOfflineMissionSelectText=Select one of the available missions. You must accomplish a mission to go onto the next one; however, you can repeat a mission if you desire.
@HelpOptions=Options
@HelpOptionsText=This category provides information designed to refine and alter your game's performance characteristics, sound playback, keyboard layout, and more.\n\nClick on each of the areas indicated here to see the options available.
@HelpOptionKeymap=Keymapping
@HelpOptionKeymapText=To change a keystroke for a command to something more convenient to your style, just double-click on any key binding shown, and then type the key you wish to use for that command in the future.\n\nNOTE: If that key existed elsewhere in your key bindings, it will be removed from the old location and used here, so try to avoid conflicts.\n\nTo change mouse sensitivity or remap any mouse buttons, first click on the mouse icon. This brings up the mouse-specific controls for you to customize. To go back to keyboard bindings, just click on the keyboard icon.\n\nYou can see which keys are already in use by looking to the right side of the screen. The keys that are highlighted are already used.\n\nWhen you are done configuring your keyboard, you should SAVE it by hitting SAVE at the bottom of the screen. You can then LOAD your configuration at any time later, if you change keysettings for any reason.
@HelpOptionVideo=Video Options
@HelpOptionVideoText=This area lets you change the appearance of your game. It is typically the place most people go to manipulate graphics to affect their framerate.\n\nGamma allows you to change the brightness of your screen, both darker and lighter.\n\nScreen resolution is straight-forward and lets you set how detailed you want your screen to be. 800x600 is the fastest possible resolution, 1024x768 is our default one (HUD elements look best there), and higher resolutions are available also.\n\nVideo Quality is the most important setting on this screen. When you first enter the game, your system is polled to analyze your graphics card, sound card, and various hardware components. A setting in Video Quality is then chosen to maximize your framerate while delivering the highest level of quality for your machine. That setting is always Recommended. That means your game is set up the way our software thinks is best. Most people can leave their settings right there and be happy.\n\nSome folks like to customize things though. To customize your graphics, switch your Video Quality to 'Custom'. This allows you to access the options inside the outlined box below. Briefly, here is a summary of those features:\n\nVideo Bit-Depth: 32-bit math is more precise and you'll see less 'swimming' in objects at distance if you leave it on this setting. However, on lower CPU machines, 16-bit Video can save significant framerate.\n\nTexture Resolution: The settings are High, Medium, and Low. Low setting will result in much blurrier textures, but will save a lot of RAM and VRAM for your machine, thus accelerating framerate for low-end systems. High resolution is only recommended for machines with lots of system RAM and video card RAM.\n\nParticle Effects: This affects your framerate mostly in combat situations. If you are seeing significant slowdowns during a firefight, you might consider turning down your particle effects. Particles are generally things like explosions, weapon effects, and impact effects.\n\nFlora Density: Because the
 grass and small bushes use alpha transparency, they can be slow on older video cards. If you are seeing a slow framerate when outside only (fast inside), then consider turning down your Flora Density, or turn it off entirely.\n\nMesh Detail: ***FILL ME IN***\n\nDetail Textures: This turns off the detail textures on grounds and walls. Although this can save you some memory, its generally a better visual effect to lower your texture resolution and leave Detail Textures 'on'. This results in a better close-up view of the art while still improving memory footprint.\n\nDecals: These are the impact markers from grenade explosions, bullet impacts, beam effects, etc. This will only save a small amount of memory.\n\nShadows: Turning off shadows will save some CPU and a bit of memory.\n\nWeather Particles: Because weather uses alpha transparency, it can be slow on some older video cards. Turning this switch off eliminates the actual rain and snow particles, but does not remove the fogging effect, so your game experience will still be the same as other players.\n\nSkydome: This turns off the sky. This can save significant memory and is recommended for 256MB machines.\n\nView Distance: WARNING! Reducing this distance will put you in situations where you cannot see another player (because your world ends closer than his does) but he can still see you. The only reason to use this slider is because you've tried all the other options and haven't gained enough framerate. This setting will dramatically reduce polygon count and is useful on our lower end CPUs and older video cards (for instance, you may want to do this on a 1.0Ghz CPU with a GeForce2 card).\n\nIf you want to see PlanetSide with maximum detail, go to the ADVANCED tab. RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT USE THIS unless you have more than 512MB of system RAM and at least 128MB of video card memory. By toggling these textures on, you will see the game in its highest texture precision...but they take a lot of memory. You can achieve great effect by upping the resolution on specifi
c categories of objects also, without turning them ALL on. This allows some improvements even if you can't afford the RAM glut for all high-res textures.
@HelpOptionSound=Sound Options
@HelpOptionSoundText=You can customize your sound driver, volumes, and music tracks in this area.\n\nSound Driver: Choose the appropriate sound driver from the list provided. If you do not have a hardware sound accelerator, you should stick with DirectSound3D Software Emulation. If you have a hardware sound accelerator, then you should try at least straight DirectSound3D Hardware Support so that your soundcard does the work of manipulating sounds instead of your system CPU.\n\n2D Sound Effects Volume: This adjusts interface sounds (clicks of buttons, mouseover sounds, etc.) as well as some larger-scale sounds, like weather.\n\n3D Sound Effects Volume: This adjusts all the other sounds in the world that require 3D-positioning so that you can get a feel for where they are in the world from your speakers.\n\nMusic volume: Adjusts the volume of the various music tracks.\n\nSound Tracks: Some folks have particular tastes in music. If you wish to turn off any particular music track, you can do so here.
@HelpOptionOther=Game Options
@HelpOptionOtherText=A few miscellaneous controls are listed here.\n\nAlways Run: If you toggle this option off, you will walk by default instead of run by default.\n\nShow Help Stars: If you turn this feature off, then you will no longer see the Help Stars over terminals, vehicles, etc. when you go into the game with a new character.\n\nRender Names: The 'All' setting means that you see everyone's names. The 'Outfit' setting means that you see everyone's names AND Outfits. The 'None' setting makes it so you don't see any names at any time. NOTE: You can also toggle through these states while in the world by hitting CTRL+N repeatedly.
@HelpHUDView=HUD Elements
@HelpHUDViewText=In general, all the elements you see on your Heads-Up Display (HUD) are described in this chapter.
@HelpHUDAlarm=Alarm
@HelpHUDAlarmText=Typing /alarm into chat will bring up the alarm window. This window lets you set a reminder. When the timer expires, a window is show you the message you set. The reminder can be a certain number of hours and minutes or at a particular time. The alarm can be automatically set each time you start the game by selecting the "On Startup" checkbox. If an alarm is already active, the status area will tell you when it is going to expire. To set the alarm, hit the "Set" button. To cancel an alarm, use the "Clear" button. 
@HelpHUDActiveItems=Holsters
@HelpHUDActiveItemsText=Any weapons you have at your disposal are shown in the form of 'Holsters' in the bar at the bottom of your screen.\n\nYou can activate a Holster by tapping the appropriate number key (1-4).\n\nIf you are in individual armor (Infiltration, Standard, Agile, Reinforced or MAX), you are equipping an available weapon into your hand so that you can fire. In a vehicle, this 'holster' indicates the weapon you have at your vehicle position (if available).\n\nThe 'dots' next to the weapon indicate firing modes. The top dot is your Primary fire mode, the second one is your Secondary fire mode, etc.\n\nThe icon directly below your holster is the type of ammunition you currently have loaded into the weapon.\n\nThe number to the left of that ammo type icon is the number of shots you have left in your clip. (NOTE: This is also indicated by the filled area behind your weapon icon in the holster area just for a quick-glance representation.)\n\nThe number to the right of the ammo icon is how many shots of that type you have left in your *inventory* so that you know how many shots you have remaining.\n\nThe weapon you currently have equipped has a highlighted holster so you can easily see that information at a glance.
@HelpHUDCharacterPane=Character Info Screen
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneText=The default key to open your Character pane is "O". On this pane you'll see your soldier's name, battle rank, command rank, certification points remaining to be spent, current grief point totals, as well as the various certifications you possess.\n\nAdditionally, your current Implants are shown on this screen. A hotkey for your implant is automatically created on your hotbar so that you can easily activate it by tapping the appropriate F-key.\n\nA button at the bottom of this pane takes you to your Character Statistics. This is the area where you can track all of your kill stats, your capture stats, etc. Take a look. There's a lot of information there.
@HelpHUDCorpse=Death & Respawn
@HelpHUDCorpseText=When you are killed, your body collapses to the ground as a 'corpse'. Don't worry...it's a temporary situation.\n\nYou'll immediately see a progress bar that takes quite a while to elapse. If that bar gets all the way to the end, you will automatically respawn and appear at your Sanctuary.\n\nHowever, you can single-click on any of the respawn locations indicated on the Respawn Interface and, after a short wait, you'll respawn at that facility, whether it be a deployed AMS, Facility or Tower.\n\nIf you don't choose a respawn location, and your auto-timer hasn't expired, then Advanced Medics can Revive you on the spot. They will come to your corpse, use their medical applicator, and if you allow it, you can be Revived immediately without being transported to a respawn location. Handy, eh?
@HelpHUDDamage=Damage Indicators
@HelpHUDDamageText=The area around your crosshairs (reticule) flashes red whenever you take damage.\n\nThe red arcs you see indicate the direction the attack is coming from, so if you watch those indicators, you can quickly turn to face your attacker and return fire.\n\nConversely, when you hit a target, your reticule will show a small orange disc to let you know that your bullet impacted.
@HelpHUDEquipment=Equipment Terminal
@HelpHUDEquipmentText=The equipment terminal is your key to all items except Vehicles and Implants.\n\nWhether it's armor, weaponry, ammo, or any of the miscellaneous items needed for hacking, engineering, medical purposes or even command.\n\nYou will only see items on these lists for which you have certifications. If you are not certified to use an item, then you will not see it in this terminal. The exceptions to that rule are vehicle ammo (which anyone can grab if they want to take it to a vehicle) and the Command Uplink device, which can only be acquired by Commanders of at least Rank 2.\n\nTo acquire an item, just double-click it and it will be placed in your inventory in any empty space available. If no empty space exists, then the item will be attached to your mouse cursor for you to drop or destroy.\n\nThe right-most tab is the FAVORITES listing. This is how you can save inventory configurations for easy future access (rather than having to select and place all those items everytime). Once you get your inventory in the shape you desire, just double-click an empty line on this interface, fill in a name for the Favorite, and hit SAVE. When you return to an equipment terminal later, you can easily double-click on this favorite (or hit the corresponding number key) and it will be auto-acquired for you. This saves you a lot of button clicking when getting inventory during a battle, so it is HIGHLY recommended that you set up your favorites ahead of time.
@HelpHUDExclamation=Help-Star Training
@HelpHUDExclamationText=When you first encounter something that is useful in the game (weapon, vehicle, terminal, capture console, generator, etc.), you will often see a three-pointed Auraxis symbol floating over the top of it.\n\nThis indicates that there is special 'help' information available there.\n\nIf you approach the object, and look straight at it, a dialog box will appear with infomation on how to use that item. (In the case of weapons, it comes up when you equip them.)\n\nTake a few moments to read these dialogs. They contain a great deal of information about how to use each item and will help you shorten your learning curve so you can just enjoy the game.\n\nAdditionally, as an incentive, the first-time help dialogs all come with an experience bonus. If you activate those help dialogs, you will get Battle Experience to help you gain rank.
@HelpHUDImplant=Implant Terminal
@HelpHUDImplantText=You receive available Implant slots at Battle Ranks 6, 12, and 18.\n\nThe only place you can fill those slots, however, is at an Implant Terminal. These terminals are available only at Bio Labs and the Sanctuary.\n\nTo use an Implant Terminal, just step onto the mount circle and press 'G' to enter the terminal.\n\nYou'll then see a screen allowing you to browse through the Implants, getting information on each of them. You can easily add or remove implants via this interface.\n\nNOTE: When you first install an Implant, it has an activation timer that must expire before the Implant will function.\n\nYour Implant's activation timer must also expire after each time you die, so be warned that you are slightly less capable immediately after death because of this.
@HelpHUDInventory=Inventory
@HelpHUDInventoryText=The Inventory pane is fairly self-explanatory, but some quick notes are appropriate.\n\nYou can left-click an object to pick it up, and then just left-click elsewhere to drop it.\n\nTo destroy an object, pick it up and then place it on the 'Destroy' button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nYou can drop an object to the ground by clicking the object and placing it on the 'Drop' button.\n\nIf you are configuring Favorites, or just want to quickly clean out your inventory, then the 'Clear All' button can be very useful. Using this button will empty out all inventory from both the grid and all avaialble holsters. You can then easily start from scratch buying equipment from a terminal or looting it from another player.\n\nThere is a 'Use Item' button, but it is mostly included for completeness. You can use an item by selecting it and then moving it to this button, or you can do it by right-clicking the object (which uses it immediately).\n\nThe easiest way to use a medkit, however, is to tap the appropriate F-key to activate the hotkey that is automatically created the first time you put a medkit in your inventory.\n\nFor ease-of-use, you can right-click any holsterable item in your inventory and it will auto-swap into one of your pistol or rifle slots (as appropriate).\n\nAlso, you can right-click any object in your inventory to move it quickly to a locker, trunk, or to take something from a loot box.
@HelpHUDLocker=Lockers
@HelpHUDLockerText=Lockers are often critical when the generator is destroyed in your facility and all the equipment terminals lose power.\n\nLockers initially start completely empty. The only way they gain items is if you put them there.\n\nItems stored in Lockers are available at ANY lockers as long as the building housing the lockers is controlled by your Empire.\n\nLockers are persistent and the items placed there will be available the each time you log in.
@HelpHUDOutfit=Oufits
@HelpHUDOutfitText=****OUTFITS****
@HelpHUDOutfitList=Outfit Listings
@HelpHUDOutfitListText=****OUTFIT LISTINGS****
@HelpHUDPlayerPane=Player Info
@HelpHUDPlayerPaneText=This window lets you manage your squad, look for squad members (or look for a squad invitation if you're not forming a squad), as well as letting you manage your Friends list.\n\nThe leftmost tab is your Squad Management pane (labled 'Squad'). It shows you all squad members, allows you to promote one of them to become squad leader, kick players out of the squad, and even leave the squad yourself.\n\nThe middle tab is your Friends List. Shown here is a complete list of your friends, as well as their on-line status. You can add, delete, or even open a mini-window that shows your friends and on-line status at a glance.\n\nThe right-most tab is the 'Find Squad' (Looking for Squad) pane. To indicate that you're looking for a squad, just click the LFS (Looking for Squad) button and folks will start to see you as available.\n\nIf you're a squad leader, you can advertise that you *need* people, or certain certifications, by clicking the LFS button.\n\nWhether you're looking for a squad or trying to fill one up, you can be very specific about what certifications you're advertising as available or looking to get into your squad.
@HelpHUDRadar=Proximity Map
@HelpHUDRadarText=This 'mini-map' allows you to see, at a glance, the area around you as you move through the world.\n\nThe map can be zoomed to three different levels, from 50m diameter to 200m diamter. (Default keys for changing zoom levels are '[' and ']'.) It will also show the interiors of buildings once you enter them for ease of navigation.\n\nCompass directions are shown for visual reference and your radar imaging will pick up enemy vehicles and show their icons there as well.\n\nSquadmates are indicated by number on the map, if they're close enough, and other friendlies are represented by dots.\n\nNOTE: If it's a red icon of any type...it's an enemy. Beware.
@HelpHUDReticle=Weapon Reticule
@HelpHUDReticleText=Your weapon's reticule gives you several pieces of critical information.\n\nThe first and foremost is that it shows you your Cone of Fire (CoF). As you fire your weapons, or take damage, or move rapidly, your CoF will expand. A large CoF is an inaccurate CoF, so you want to keep it as small as possible.\n\nTo understand how a CoF works, just imagine a cone that projects outward from your muzzle toward the horizon. The reticule outlines the current 'base' of that cone. So therefore, the wider that base is, the larger the potential impact area is as the bullets trace a line between your weapon's muzzle (the tip of the cone) and a random point somewhere on the base of the cone.\n\nAdditionally, when you hit a target with bullets, your reticule will 'pulse' letting you know that you've hit that target.\n\nLastly, the reticule shows you whether you're in-range of a target. If you center your reticule on a target, the reticule will turn more solid if the target is in range.
@HelpHUDShortcuts=Shortcuts
@HelpHUDShortcutsText=This shortcut bar is setup to allow you to easily activate/deactivate your implants, quickly use medkits, and to hang text macro icons once you create them.\n\nImplant and medkit shortcuts are created automatically when you have those items, but text macros have to be created manually.\n\nTo create a text macro, type /macro in your chat pane, followed by a three-letter descriptor tag, and then the actual chat command you want to execute.\n\nFor instance: /macro RAL /squad Retreat! Fall back to Squad Waypoint One!\n\nThe macro above would create a square icon with the letters "RAL" (short for RALLY) on it. You'd place that icon in your hotbar and then, when the appropriate F-key is pressed, the text macro will go off. In this case, the macro would result in a squad chat sentence saying "Retreat! Fall back to Squad Waypoint One!" and could be used to quickly order a retreat.
@HelpHUDSquad=Squad
@HelpHUDSquadText=A squad is composed of up to 10 other players. The chief advantages of being in a squad are a) shared experience and b) communication and command.\n\nAll squad members share all experience gained by other squad members as long as you are on the same continent as those other squad members. NOTE: Experience is not divided. If one person gets 50xp for an action, then all other squad members will ALSO get 50xp.\n\nIn addition to the experience sharing, squads can use the /squad chat channel (or /s) to speak to one another easily without others overhearing. You can also use ALT+# to give a quick /tell to another squadmate.\n\nThere are also Command features that allow easier communications with squadmates.\n\nYou will find, after playing a bit, that squads are the easiest way to earn experience and that being involved in a squad is some of the best gaming you can get. Enjoy!
@HelpHUDStatus=Soldier Status
@HelpHUDStatusText=A soldier has three main statistics: Health, Armor, and Stamina.\n\nHealth is self-explanatory, but when you reach zero in this category, you are dead.\n\nArmor equates to the amount of protection you gain when wearing any particular armored suit. Infiltration suits have the least (with no armor at all), while MAX units have the most (at 650 armor).\n\nStamina is used when powering Implants. You also lose Stamina as a byproduct of taking damage. The more damage you take, the bigger the Stamina hit is.
@HelpHUDStatistics=Statistics
@HelpHUDStatisticsText=All your soldier's personal statistics are tracked here. From how many types of armor you've killed, to how many base captures you've participated in, to how many vehicles you've destroyed (and what types), this area keeps track of all your personal adventures so you can see your own progress.
@HelpHUDTrade=Trade
@HelpHUDTradeText=By getting close to another soldier and hitting "G" to interact with that player, you can access the 'Trade' function.\n\nWith this feature, you can securely trade items to other players without having to drop the item on the ground and having the other player pick it up.\n\nTo use the interface, first place the item to be traded into your side of the window, and then click the TRADE button.\n\nOnce the other player finalizes the trade by clicking his CONFIRM button, the trade is accomplished and the item swaps to that other player's inventory.\n\nNOTE: The other player must have room for the items in his inventory or the trade will be cancelled and you will retain possession of the items.
@HelpHUDTrunk=Trunk
@HelpHUDTrunkText=Each vehicle has a trunk. That trunk is where all ammunition for the vehicle is stored, and there is some extra room in there for carrying other miscelleous items (like a nano-dispenser to repair your vehicle with, or some personal ammo).\n\nYou can lock your trunk so that other players can't access it in your Vehicle Permissions window, accessed from the Soldier Management Menu.
@HelpHUDVehicle=Vehicle Terminal
@HelpHUDVehicleText=You can aquire Vehicles from this type of terminal. The type of vehicles available is dependent on two things: a) Whether you're certified in a vehicle or not, and b) Which type of vehicle terminal you are accessing.\n\nThe vehicle terminal will only show you vehicle options for which you are certified.\n\nAdditionally, there are Ground Vehicle terminals and Air Vehicle terminals. Different facilities have different types of vehicles available, although all facilities have a Ground Vehicle Terminal. NOTE: Only Sanctuaries and Dropship Centers give you access to the Galaxy Dropship.\n\nThe last thing to consider is that whether your Empire owns a Technology Plant on the continent you're standing on will determine whether or not "Advanced" vehicles are available at the vehicle terminal or not. Most of the heavier vehicles (like heavy tanks, Sunderer, Reaver, and the heavy buggies) will not be available unless your Empire owns a Technology Plant.
@HelpHUDVehicleAccess=Vehicle Access
@HelpHUDVehicleAccessText=You can set permissions for your vehicle on the Vehicle Permissions pane, accessed from your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nFirst, click the Soldier Management Menu icon to expand the list upward.\n\nThen click the Vehicle icon.\n\nThis brings up a dialog allowing you to do several things: 1) You can set permissions for who can drive the vehicle (click one of the radio buttons to choose); 2) You can set permissions on who can access the trunk of the vehicle, and; 3) You can kick people out of the vehicle if you don't want them there.
@HelpHUDWindow=General Window
@HelpHUDWindowText=****GENERAL WINDOW****
@HelpMapView=Map
@HelpMapViewText=This section describes how to use the various Map features.
@HelpMapGlobal=Global Map
@HelpMapGlobalText=This map, at-a-glance, gives you SOI information for every facility in the world. From here, you can double-click on a continent to zoom in to it's continent-scale view, and you can analyze weather patterns as they move across the world so you can better time attacks and defenses accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, this view lets you see any Continental or Population locks that occur. This gives you the info you need to determine where you will go each day when you log-in.\n\nHotspots are shown here also. Hotspots occur anywhere where large groups of people are fighting. Use them to more easily navigate to areas of contention.
@HelpMapContinent=Continent Map
@HelpMapContinentText=The continent map is where you'll get most of the information you need for close tactical decisions.\n\nYou can easily zoom in and out of the map by either using your mouse wheel, or the zoom in/out buttons.\n\nMost features on the map can be toggled on/off by either clicking on the option in the Display list, or using the corresponding hotkey. (For instance, toggling Weather off is the 'W' key.)\n\nTo see Towers or friendly deployables, you need to zoom in far enough so that resolution is high enough to tell the objects apart.\n\nConversely, to see Weather on a continent, you need to zoom out to the farthest level.\n\nExperiment with the other buttons to see what they do, and refer to the Legend to see what they symbols mean.
@HelpMapDroppod=Droppod Map
@HelpMapDroppodText=This interface is shown after you board the HART and ascend to the stratosphere.\n\nThe image looks like the Global Map, but is used to decide your drop zone location.\n\nTo do this, first double-click on a continent. Once you get to the continent view, you can single-click anywhere on the map to designate a drop zone.\n\nOnce you've selected a drop zone, just hit the 'Deploy Pod' button to leave this interface and streak to the chosen location below.
@HelpEquipment=Equipment
@HelpEquipmentText=*** Game equipment ***
@HelpStaticObjects=Facility Features
@HelpStaticObjectsText=This section includes descriptions of the various terminals in Facilities, as well as things like Phalanx Wall Turrets and Warpgates.
@HelpGameplay=Gameplay
@HelpGameplayText=****GAMEPLAY****
@HelpSquads=Squads
@HelpSquadsText=A squad is composed of up to 10 other players. The chief advantages of being in a squad are a) shared experience and b) communication and command.\n\nAll squad members share all experience gained by other squad members as long as you are on the same continent as those other squad members. NOTE: Experience is not divided. If one person gets 50xp for an action, then all other squad members will ALSO get 50xp.\n\nIn addition to the experience sharing, squads can use the /squad chat channel (or /s) to speak to one another easily without others overhearing. You can also use ALT+# to give a quick /tell to another squadmate.\n\nThere are also Command features that allow easier communications with squadmates.\n\nYou will find, after playing a bit, that squads are the easiest way to earn experience and that being involved in a squad is some of the best gaming you can get. Enjoy!
@HelpSquadJoin=Join
@HelpSquadJoinText=To join a squad, you must first be invited by that squad's leader.\n\nOnce he invites you, a dialog will appear asking you whether you want to join the squad or not. Just click 'YES' to join the squad.\n\nOnce you've joined the squad, you may be invited to an existing voice conference if one is available.
@HelpSquadCreate=Create
@HelpSquadCreateText=To create a squad, you simply have to invite another player to join your squad. Once that player agrees to join, your squad is formed and you're the squad's leader.\n\nTo invite another player, just type /invite XXXXX where XXXXX is the player's name.\n\nThere are various options available to you now. They are on the Squad menu. Hit "P" to open the window, and then click on the tab labled "Squad". From this pane, you can get information about your squadmates, kick them, promote them to squad leader, and start voice conferences. 
@HelpSquadLeave=Leave
@HelpSquadLeaveText=To leave a squad, hit 'P' to open the window, then click on the "Squad" tab. This shows your squad listing.\n\nAt that point, just click the 'LEAVE' button and you will remove yourself from the squad.
@HelpSquadCommands=Commands
@HelpSquadCommandsText=As a CR2 Commander, you can give Directed Voice Macros to your squadmates.\n\nTo do this, left-mouse click the squadmate, and then use a 'V' menu voice macro to give a command.\n\nFor instance, click your squadmate 'Avenger' and type VAC. Avenger will then receive the following chat message: 'Squad Command: Hack the Control Console!'.\n\nIn this way, you can give quick commands without tying your fingers up typing. The message goes *only* to the intended recipients (you can select multiple squadmates to give a command to) so it can be more focused and useful than just using Voice chat.

@HelpChat=Chat
@HelpChatText=The chat pane is divided into two panes. These are the Status Pane and the Chat Pane.\n\nThe Status Pane is the top-half of this element and all kill messages, facility status messages, and victory/loss messages appear here.\n\nThe Chat Pane is the lower-half of the element and all speaking done by other players is seen here.\n\nAdditionally, there are SEND and RECEIVE buttons on the border. These buttons allow you to choose which chat mode your are speaking in (SEND) as well as which chat channels you are listening to (RECEIVE). They are easily customized to your likings.\n\nThe last feature of the Chat Pane is the 'LFS' button. This is an easy way to access the 'Looking for Squad' feature. Click on it to advertise you are looking for a squad to join, or use it as a squad leader to advertise for squad members.
@HelpChatChannels=Channels
@HelpChatChannelsText=There are five chat channels you can access. They are: Local, Squad, Outfit, Command, and Broadcast.\n\nLocal chat is 'open' chat. Everything you say is heard by all friendly units in your immediate area. This is the most common way to chat with folks outside your squad.\n\nSquad chat is heard only by other squad members. It's reliable communication during combat.\n\nOutfit chat is exactly like Squad chat, except that it sends to a potentially larger group...your Outfit.\n\nCommand chat can only be accessed by Commanders of CR3 or better. This is a global channel that allows Commanders to speak directly with one another and increases coordination of the Empires.\n\nFinally, but very importantly, Broadcast chat allows all friendly units to speak with any other friendly units within the area of any non-enemy SOI. Therefore, you can easily chat with soldiers of your same Empire around any facilities except those held by your enemies.\n\nEach chat channel has a shortcut to prevent you from having to change chat channels via the SEND menu all the time. Those shortcuts are:\n/l Local\n/s Squad\n/o Outfit\n/b Broadcast\n/c Command
@HelpChatFilters=Filters
@HelpChatFiltersText=You can easily define which chat channels you want to listen to by accessing the 'RECEIVE' pull-down menu on your chat pane.\n\nUn-click any chat channel you don't wish to listen to and that chat will cease to appear in your chat pane.
@HelpChatCommands=Commands
@HelpChatCommandsText=****COMMANDS****
@HelpChatMacros=Macros
@HelpChatMacrosText=Voice macros are used as a quick substitute for extensive typing for commonly used phrases in the game.\n\nMost chat macros are mnemonic, meaning that the first letter of each step stands for what the option on the menu that starts with that letter.\n\nExample: VVA = Voice + Very Quick + Anytime! = Your character saying "Anytime!". Another example is VAM = Voice + Attack + Medical Terminal = Your character saying "Attack their Medical Terminal!".\n\nThe categories make quick sense if you spend a few moments investigating the sub-menus. A = Attack, D = Defense, R = Repair, and so on.\n\nThus, with just a few keystrokes, you can quickly whip off standard commands and acknowledgements.\n\nDon't forget that you can use text macros to supplement your voice macro menus. (See Shortcuts help for more info on text macros.)

# Bitchin' Betty Virtual Shooting Range
@betty_shooting_range_01=Welcome, soldier. You're currently in the Virtual Shooting Range, which is part of the overall Virtual Training System.\nBefore entering battle in the real world, you're encouraged to experiment with different equipment here. While in the Virtual Training System, all equipment is available to you - there are no certification restrictions. However, when you exit the Virtual Training System, the vast majority of equipment will be restricted again until you gain the needed experience and certifications.\nWhen you're ready to lay waste to the targets out there, go ahead and walk up to an Equipment Terminal and arm yourself. Finally, when you're ready to move on, simply walk into the exit portal in the center of the pavilion, which allows you to select your initial certification, and then move to the Virtual Driving Area. 
@betty_shooting_range_02=All right, let's get you licensed to use some starting equipment.\nRemember, in the Virtual Training System certifications are disabled, letting you try out everything. But when you're out on the real battlefield, you'll only be able to use equipment for which you have the required certification. Feel free to browse until you find one you like.\nLearn your chosen certification by clicking its name and hitting the "Learn" button at the bottom of the screen. If you accidentally choose the wrong certification, don't worry. Just select that certification name and click the "Unlearn" button to forget the certification and use the points again elsewhere. NOTE: There is no time penalty for unlearning a certification in the VR Training area, however, when you do this in the real world, there is a 24-hour "unlearning" period that must be passed before being able to spend your cert points elsewhere.\nAfter doing so, you can head into the Virtual Driving Area to test-drive some vehicles and then choose your starting vehicle certification. And if you want to try out some of the equipment a bit more before deciding, just close the certification menu to remain in the Shooting Range. 
@betty_driving_area_01=Vehicles are a faster, more convenient mode of transportation than your weary feet. They can also be powerful weapons of destruction on the battlefield. This Virtual Driving Area is available for you to try out each of the various vehicles available to our Empire.\nLike the Virtual Shooting Range, there are no certification restrictions within the Virtual Driving Area. To get your ride, walk up to any of the vehicle pads that are scattered across this small island and access a Vehicle Terminal.\nWhen you're ready to leave the VR Driving Area, just walk into an exit portal, which then lets you select your initial vehicle certification before leaving Virtual Reality.
@betty_driving_area_02=Welcome back to Certifications. This time, you're selecting a vehicle in which to certify. You must spend the two certification points provided here on at least one vehicle. If you've earned more certification points in the training areas, you can spend more, but you must spend at least two on a vehicle certification before you can leave.\nWhen choosing a certification, remember that while single person vehicles can be great at getting around, multi-personnel vehicles offer more protection and provide you with the ability to bring along extra squadmates.\nOnce you've selected your vehicle certification, you'll be able to continue in any of the available training programs, or exit to your Empire's Sanctuary.
@betty_combat_zone=When you're out in the real battlefield, unlike in the Virtual Shooting Range, your enemies are likely to shoot back - if not first! Don't worry. That's why the Virtual Combat Zone program was created.to allow you to square off against targets that will actively try to take you out.\nHowever, dying here is without consequence. There are three separate areas where you'll combat lightly-armed opponents all the way up to heavily-outfitted and armored enemies. The area you're currently facing is the least difficult area, whereas the area to the right of it is more dangerous, and the area at the other end of the Virtual Combat Zone is the most hazardous to your health.\nEquipment terminals are located at both at the entrance and the back of each area.\nWhen you're ready to suit up and head into the real battlefield - or if you want to switch to a different training program - walk into a nearby exit portal. 
@betty_sanctuary_tr=So you're ready to serve the Terran Republic.\nThis is your Empire's home Sanctuary. This 'home island' is a complete safe-haven from enemy activity. Here you'll only find other friendlies that belong to your Empire.\nThere's always strength in numbers, so don't be shy about looking to join a squad before venturing forth into the battlefield. And remember, you can return to the Virtual Training System whenever you want to polish your skills more.
@betty_sanctuary_nc=So you're ready to serve the New Conglomerate.\nThis is your Empire's home Sanctuary. This 'home island' is a complete safe-haven from enemy activity. Here you'll only find other friendlies that belong to your Empire.\nThere's always strength in numbers, so don't be shy about looking to join a squad before venturing forth into the battlefield. And remember, you can return to the Virtual Training System whenever you want to polish your skills more.
@betty_sanctuary_vs=So you're ready to serve the Vanu Sovereigncy.\nThis is your Empire's home Sanctuary. This 'home island' is a complete safe-haven from enemy activity. Here you'll only find other friendlies that belong to your Empire.\nThere's always strength in numbers, so don't be shy about looking to join a squad before venturing forth into the battlefield. And remember, you can return to the Virtual Training System whenever you want to polish your skills more.
@betty_equipment_01=All right, soldier, this is an Equipment Terminal - the most important terminal on the battlefield. The Equipment Terminal is where you obtain weapons, body armor, support devices, vehicular ammo, and this is where you manage your Favorites. Your current inventory is displayed to the right of the Equipment Terminal listing.
@betty_equipment_02=There are two ways to grab items from the equipment terminal. The first way is to left-click once on the graphical icon of the item, selecting it, then left-click on the Obtain button. The second way is to simply double-left click on the graphical item. As long as there's room within your personal inventory, the item will be automatically transferred into it.
@betty_equipment_03=You can also trash items from your personal inventory via the Recycle button - to do so, just left-click on an item. This turns the mouse cursor into the item. Then just left-click on the Recycle button, and the item will be removed.
@betty_equipment_04=The items available at the equipment terminal are divided into five separate tabs for your shopping convenience. Only equipment for which you possess certifications will be listed (unless you are in the Virtual Training areas, in which case all items are listed). Don't worry though, as you gain ranks and certifications, the list of available equipment will grow.
@betty_equipment_05a=The default tab that's flashing currently is the Weapons and Ammunition tab. Weapons are displayed as icons, directly followed by their respective ammo icons. As mentioned earlier, simply double left-click on an item's icon to obtain it.
@betty_equipment_05b=The next tab is the Body Armor tab, which allows you to change into different body armor types. As with other equipment, you must be certified in other body armor variants in order to see it on the list and obtain it. Body Armor varies in strength, as well as the number of holsters and available inventory space. Typically the stronger the armor, the slower the mobility speed.
@betty_equipment_05c=The middle tab is Support Equipment - here you can acquire default items such as medkits, and the invaluable remote electronics kit (REK).
@betty_equipment_05d=The Vehicle Ammo tab allows you to purchase vehicular ammo. Vehicles are fed ammo from their trunks, so to resupply a vehicle you just get the vehicular ammo, then place it directly into the vehicle's trunk.
@betty_equipment_06=The last tab is the Favorites tab, and it's well-named. Whereas the other tabs deal with obtaining individual pieces of equipment, the Favorites listing allows you to both save and recall fully loaded configurations. So essentially you can take a snapshot of your current inventory - body armor, weapons, and equipment - and save it to recall later at an Equipment Terminal.
@betty_equipment_07a=To save a favorite, left-click on an Empty Configuration slot. Then just left-click on the Save button underneath the list.
@betty_equipment_07b=You can name the favorite whatever you want for handy reference later. You can also overwrite existing favorites in the same manner. To load a saved favorite, you have two options available. The first method is to left-click once on the favorite, selecting it, then left-click on the Obtain favorite button.
@betty_equipment_07c=The other way is to double left-click on the favorite, which will replace your current configuration. You can delete a favorite by selecting it, then left-clicking on the Delete button.
@betty_equipment_07d=Last, but far from least, there are checkboxes next to each favorite. This is your Respawn Favorite. What this means is that if you die and respawn, you'll come back fully equipped with the selected Favorite.
@betty_equipment_08=All right, it's time to let you grab your gear. When you're done, either left-click on the X button at the upper right, or simply step away from the Equipment Terminal to exit the menu.
@betty_vehicle=This is a vehicle terminal where you can obtain vehicles.\nTo get a vehicle, you must first have the necessary certification. In the Virtual Driving Area, you can test drive any vehicles without certification restrictions. In the real battlefield, only vehicles that you possess certifications for will appear in the listing.\nTo acquire a vehicle, double-left click on the vehicle icon and it will be manufactured onto the pad in front of the vehicle terminal.\nAt that point you must enter the vehicle's driver position and drive it off the pad. If you don't remove the vehicle from the pad, it will be automatically deconstructed after a short time. Don't block traffic, soldier.
@betty_map_01=Okay, Soldier...this is the Map Pane. It shows you where you can go, how to get there, and what sort of threat you'll face once you arrive. In otherwords, it's your primary source of info on where the battles are and how to get to them.
@betty_map_02=You're looking at the global map view, which shows all Battle Continents where the Empires are waging war. The Sanctuaries are also shown here, which are the protected safe-havens for each of the Empires. Left-clicking once on a continent selects it and shows its warp gate connections, and also provides a local overview of friendly and enemy activity via the Continental Threat Indicator.  If you want to know how dangerous a continent currently is, then you definitely want to view the Continental Threat Indicator before jumping blindly into the battlefield. If the number is 1 or less, the danger is relatively low, but if it climbs to 2 or higher, then the continent has a high concentration of enemies. The color of the continent also lets you get an overview of the enemy activity on any continent - just as enemies that appear on your radar are red, the color red also designates a high continental danger factor. But your job isn't to avoid danger - it's to seek it. When you jump into hot zones, you'll be awarded more experience for earning ranks. So basically the more dangerous the continent, the higher the rewards for serving your Empire.
@betty_map_03=When zooming into the full continental display both the names of the facilities as well as facility types are displayed. Furthermore, you see which Empires own what facilities, based on the circular Spheres of Influence. Blue spheres represent the New Conglomerate, Red Spheres represent the Terran Republic, and Green Spheres represent the Vanu Sovereignty. The names of the continents that the warp gates connect are also shown next to each warp gate.
@betty_map_04=A number of tools are also available to you, allowing you to zoom in further as well as toggle different elements from the map display. Rolling the mouse pointer over buttons will give you a quick synopsis of what each button does. Remember, soldier, the map is your friend - it keeps you from getting lost, it shows you how to get around, and it points you to the action. Use it often.

#Bitchin' Betty First-Time Tips
@betty_tip_welcome=Welcome, soldier. You'll make a fine addition to the Empire. You're currently outside of the Main Base on our protected Sanctuary. Don't worry -- there's no combat here. Feel free to explore the Main Base and familiarize yourself with the area. Located nearby are vehicle stations, the Drop Facilities, and the main Sanctuary base itself. Farther afield are the gigantic warp gates that link this Sanctuary with the other continents of the world. As you look around, you'll encounter a number of objects that have floating icons above them that look like this. If you approach these icons you'll be given explanations as to what the objects they're next to do. You'll even earn a little experience in the process. Now go ahead and look around -- and don't forget you can return to the Virtual Reality Training Centers anytime to check out equipment, weapons or vehicles...and even earn a little experience.
@betty_tip_facility_orbital_shuttle=Welcome to the Drop Facility building. There are two Drop Facilities -- the other is located on the other side of the Main Base. These have HART shuttles regularly over-flying the various continents of the world.By choosing a drop destination on the drop zone interface (available on the HART shuttle) you can achieve orbital re-entry to any of the continents on Auraxis.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_training=The Virtual Training Center provides access to the Virtual Shooting Range, Virtual Driving Zone, and Virtual Combat. All three off these virtual zones allow you to freely try out equipment without certification restrictions.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_shooting=Welcome to the Virtual Shooting Range where you can test-fire any weapon against the various targets in the field. To obtain a weapon, simply walk up to an equipment terminal and press the action key. Note that all damage against friendlies is disabled.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_driving=Welcome to the Virtual Driving Zone where you can test-drive any vehicle on terrain encompassing varying levels of difficulty.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_combat=Welcome to Virtual Combat where you can practice in a live-fire environment. The targets here will shoot at you, but there's no penalty to dying. To equip yourself, simply walk up to an equipment terminal and press the action key. Eliminating the targets will provide you with a small measure of Battle Experience Points, which are used for your primary rank advancement. Virtual Combat is only available through Battle Rank 6.
@betty_tip_pane_inventory=The Inventory Pane is where you manage the equipment you're carrying. On the left are holsters for weapons or equipment to equip-in-hand, and on the right is backpack space to store other items and ammunition. There are also four buttons: Use, Drop, Destroy, and Clear Inventory. Note that different body amor types have varying holster and backpack capacities.
@betty_tip_pane_character=The Character Pane displays your current Battle Rank and progress toward your next Battle Rank. Also shown are the Command Rank and progress toward its next rank. Grief Points record how much damage you've inflicted against other friendlies. Amassing Grief Points will result in punishment, but Grief Points also dissipate slowly to account for accidental friendly fire. Your current certifications are also listed, as well as any implants you ultimately obtain. You can also access your Personal Stats by pressing the Stats Button.
@betty_tip_pane_squad=The Squad Pane shows your current squad information, and assists you in finding other players to group, as well as managing your friends list.
@betty_tip_pane_map=The Map Screen has three different view levels. Global, which shows all continents and their warp gate links. Continental, which shows a full view of the selected continent and its corresponding threat indication. This view can be easily zoomed into by using the five pre-set zoom buttons at the bottom of the screen. Thus, you can easily move all the way down to a close tactical view of the area, as well as seeing a continental tactical view.
@betty_tip_pane_vehicle=The Vehicle Pane lets you control access settings for your present vehicle.
@betty_tip_pane_outfit=The Outfit Pane allows you access to your Outfit Information. You must belong to an Outfit before this button becomes active. To form an Outfit, a squad must have 10 members, none of which can already belong to an Outfit. The Squad Leader can then click on the Outfit Button and create an Outfit if everyone in the squad consents. From that point forward the Outfit button will provide access to Outfit Information for everyone within the Outfit.
@betty_tip_battle_rank_congrats=Congratulations, you have your earned Battle Rank 2. Each Battle Rank will award you further certification points to spend on other certifications, and other benefits as well.
@betty_tip_combat_rank_congrats=Congratulations, you have earned your first Command Rank. As you advance in Command Rank, you'll gain further access to special tactical commands.
@betty_tip_implant_congrats=Congratulations, you have earned your first Implant slot. Implants allow you to further specialize your character with such options as health regenerators, defense, and advanced targeting. To obtain an implant, go to an Implants Terminal. Additional implant slots will be awarded at higher Battle Ranks.
@betty_tip_warpgate_congrats=You have just entered the confines of a Warp Gate. To warp to the linked Battle Continent, proceed to the central warp core. Refer to your Global Map for the warp gate connections.

# Offline Mission 1
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission1_01=Welcome, soldier. This is the first in a series of training exercises to get you primed for battle, so that you can maximize your potential in littering the battlefield with the bodies of those that oppose us. We'll be covering the Heads-Up Display, Movement, Identifying Friend and Foe, and Weapon Handling in this exercise.\n\nAlso, to toggle this information pane on or off at any time, tap the F12 key.\n\nBefore we go any further, let's go over your Heads-Up Display, or HUD for short. We'll start with the Chat pane.
@OfflineMission1_02=The Chat pane is split into two sections. The top part is where status messages appear – generally who killed who in the nearby vicinity, as well as other updates. The bottom part is where you can communicate with other friendly soldiers. The default channel is Local Chat, which broadcasts to anyone within a short proximity of your location. You'll find Chat to be very useful when coordinating with other friendlies.
@OfflineMission1_03=The Proximity Map displays up to a 200 meter radius. The arrow represents both your location and your heading. This will be detailed further in a later training exercise.
@OfflineMission1_04=The Status Bar provides you with access to the proximity map, along with your health, stamina, armor, hotkeys, holsters, and soldier management menu.
@OfflineMission1_05=The Proximity map button lets you toggle the Proximity map display on or off.	
@OfflineMission1_06=Your health, stamina, and armor are shown in these gauges. As you take damage, the health gauge will decrease – if it disappears completely, you'll be one with the dirt. You don't want that. Next is Stamina, which is depleted through jumping, incurring health damage, or using Implants. Lastly, armor is lost when absorbing damage from projectiles or explosive-based weaponry.
@OfflineMission1_07=These are your hotkeys, which are useful for aliasing items like medkits and implants for quick usage. This will be covered later.
@OfflineMission1_08=Next are your holsters, which show you what items you have ready to be equipped, as well as what number to press to equip the respective items. Right now you aren't carrying anything, so the holsters are empty.
@OfflineMission1_09=Last, but not least, you have the Soldier Management Menu button, which when pressed provides you with access to your Inventory, Character Info, Squad Info, Map View, Vehicle Access Settings, and Outfit Info.
@OfflineMission1_10=Now let's get you started with moving around; standing still is an open invitation to death from our enemies. Proceed to the next waypoint using the basic movement controls and the mouse to look around. If you want to adjust the Key Mappings or invert the free-look, simply access the Options menu and select Key Mappings at any time.\n\n\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Options Menu - Escape\n
@OfflineMission1_11=Take a good look at these fellows, soldier. They belong to all three opposing Empires.\n\nTarget the New Conglomerate soldier.
@OfflineMission1_12=This soldier belongs to the New Conglomerate. Their primary colors are blue and yellow. You'll see these colors on all of their body armor variants, as well as their vehicles.\n\nNext target the Terran Republic soldier.
@OfflineMission1_13=This soldier belongs to the Terran Republic. Their primary colors are red and black. You'll see these colors on all of their body armor variants, as well as their vehicles.\n\nNow target the Vanu Sovereignty soldier.
@OfflineMission1_14=This soldier belongs to the Vanu Sovereignty. Their primary colors are purple and green. You'll see these colors on all of their body armor variants, as well as their vehicles.
@OfflineMission1_15=The color of their name indicates whether they're friend or foe. Now if the name above a soldier or vehicle is red, then that's an enemy – there are no exceptions. If the name above the soldier or vehicle in your view is green, then it's a friendly. Likewise, if the soldier's name is gold, it's a friendly that's a member within your squad.\n\nNow take a look at these soldiers – you'll note that one has his name in green, while the other two soldiers have their names in red. This is based on your original Empire selection you made prior to entering training. The soldier with the green name is a friendly belonging to the same Empire as yourself, whereas the other two belong to the opposing Empires.\n\nTo help you better recognize friendlies and enemies in different body armor configurations, we'll go ahead and cycle through the common body armor that you'll encounter both friend and foe wearing in the battlefield.
@OfflineMission1_16=Your Proximity Map is also of great service when identifying friend from foe. Friendlies will always appear on your Proximity Map, whereas enemies will not. However, when you see the name of an enemy, it will appear on the Proximity Map as a red icon. Furthermore, if you're in a squad, this will be automatically shared to their Proximity Map as well.\n\nWhen you're ready, proceed to the next waypoint.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission1_17=In the distance you'll notice there are three soldiers. However, their names don't immediately appear. When soldiers are fairly close range, their names immediately appear when within your view. However, when soldiers exceed that range, you must target the soldier and their name will appear.\n\nTarget all three of the soldiers in the distance to discover whether they're friend or foe.
@OfflineMission1_18=Good! Again, it's vital to recognize friend from foe. You don't want to end up gunning down a friendly! They won't appreciate it, and nor will your Empire. Just remember, if you see the name in red, it's definitely an enemy.\n\nProceed to the next waypoint.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission1_19=Well, well, it looks like some careless soldier has dropped some equipment on the ground. This is a good opportunity to show you how to pick up equipment off the ground. Go up to all of the nearby items, target them at close range, then tap the Action key to pick up each item. You must pick up each item before being able to proceed.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission1_20=Let's see what Santa left you. You picked up a Suppressor, which is a trusty submachine gun, as well as a Beamer, which is a Vanu Sovereignty pistol. You also grabbed ammo for both. This is your lucky day!\n\nNow if you look at your holsters in the Status Bar, you'll now see two small icons representing the Suppressor and Beamer next to their respective Holster numbers. Directly underneath them is their ammunition. The number on the left represents how much ammo is in the gun, and the number on the right represents how much additional ammo is in the backpack. To equip an item that's in a Holster, just press the respective number. You can also holster the item in the same manner. Go ahead and equip the Suppressor.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Equip Suppressor - 2\n
@OfflineMission1_21=Feeling dangerous yet? Well, before you scratch that itch to pull that trigger, let's cover the holsters display a bit more. You'll first notice that the Suppressor's holster icon now has been highlighted, showing you that you've equipped it. To the left of the Suppressor icon is a small dot – this indicates the current firing mode. The Suppressor only has one firing mode, but many weapons and items have additional firing modes. For example, if you look at the Beamer, there are two dots next to it, indicating the Beamer has two firing mode. Lastly, between the ammunition is a colored icon – this shows you what type of ammunition you have in your weapon.\n\nNow head to the next waypoint to test out your new toy.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission1_22=Looks like we've got an enemy out there! Here's where you can practice using your Suppressor.\n\nA few notes before you begin. First, notice the circular reticule – this is your Cone of Fire – your shots will fall within this cone. However, it is adversely affected by moving, jumping, and firing a weapon in full auto. Running and gunning can prove to be very inaccurate beyond short range.\n\nSubsequently it's recommend to crouch or remain stationary as often as possible when firing a weapon to achieve maximum accuracy. Certain weapons also have extremely high recoil penalties, and when using these weapons it's best to fire in short, controlled bursts.\n\nNow go ahead and eliminate that enemy soldier. Remember to reload when necessary.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Reload - R\n        Fire - LMB\n
@OfflineMission1_23=Great job! Of course, keep in mind that real enemies will shoot back. But that's for later. Now earlier you picked up a couple ammo types for your Suppressor – standard 9mm bullets, which are what you're using now, and armor-piercing 9mm bullets.\n\nStandard 9mm bullets are best against soldiers, but notably weaker against vehicles. Armor-piercing 9mm bullets, on the other hand, are highly effective against enemy vehicles and other hard targets, but less effective against enemy soldiers.\n\nLet's show you the difference. There's a light assault buggy called the Harasser out there – send it to the junkyard! Fire off some of your current standard 9mm bullets into it and watch its health bar. Then swap ammunition to armor-piercing and shoot the Harasser some more – again, watch the health bar to see the difference. If you forget what ammo type is currently in the Suppressor at any point, remember to look at the color next to the ammo count.\n\nNow blow that Harasser to kingdom come! And be careful – you don't want to be standing near the Harasser when it explodes.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Reload - R\n        Swap Ammo Type - X\n        Fire - LMB\n
@OfflineMission1_24=So much for those wheels. Now, before we conclude this segment of the training, equip the Beamer pistol.\n\n        Equip Beamer - 1\n
@OfflineMission1_25=This Beamer is part of the Vanu Sovereignty arsenal. Unlike many conventional weapons which have both standard ammunition and armor-piercing ammunition, the Vanu Sovereignty has both modes built into their weapons and you can toggle between them in different firing modes. However, the Beamer consumes twice as many units of energy when firing in armor-piercing mode versus standard mode.\n\nNow whereas with the Suppressor you swapped ammunition types, the Beamer will let you toggle between Firing Modes. Remember to reference the dots to the left of your Beamer holster to see your current firing mode.\n\nNow kill that enemy soldier using Standard Bolts, then destroy the Basilisk using Armor-Piercing Bolts.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Reload - R\n        Fire - LMB\n        Toggle Firing Mode - RMB\n
@OfflineMission1_26=Excellent work! That concludes this exercise. If you want to get more target practice in before heading out into battle, be sure to visit the Virtual Shooting Range on your home Sanctuary. There you can experiment with a multitude of weapons in a safe environment.
@OfflineMission_Ammo=You used up all your ammunition! For the purposes of this exercise, we'll automatically resupply you, but out in the real battlefield you might want to be a bit more conservative.

# Offline Mission 2
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission2_01=Welcome to the Certifications & Equipment exercise, soldier. In this exercise we'll be covering Certifications, Inventory and the Equipment Terminal.\n\nFirst we'll go over the difference between Reticule mode and Cursor mode. Reticule mode is your standard free-look mode where you move the mouse to look around. Cursor mode, on the other hand, is when the mouse pointer is enabled, disabling free-look. Cursor mode commonly occurs when managing your Inventory or accessing an Equipment Terminal - basically whenever you're dealing with any kind of interface.\n\nGo ahead and enter Cursor mode then left-click on the Soldier Management Menu, then click on the backpack icon to access your Inventory.\n\n        Toggle Cursor Mode - Tab\n
@OfflineMission2_02=Great. What's showing right now is your default inventory - whenever you are killed and respawn, this is your default inventory configuration. On the left side are your holsters. These are numbered - pressing the respective number will toggle equipping or holstering the respective item in that holster. Other soldiers will see what you have attached to holsters. On the right is internal backpack space - this is invisible to other soldiers, and allows you to store ammunition, med kits, and other support equipment.\n\nThe number of holsters and backpack space varies based on different body armor types. Right now you're wearing the default Standard Issue body armor, which has one small holster, one large holster, and moderate space in your backpack. Bulkier armor offers more holsters and backpack space, along with increased protection, at the cost of reduced mobility.\n\nYou're looking rather harmless right now; let's remedy that. First close your Inventory pane by left-clicking on the upper-right X button. \n\n        Close Inventory - Escape\n
@OfflineMission2_03=You'll notice that you've automatically been returned to Reticule mode. This is because you've closed the Inventory pane. Remember that you can toggle between reticule and cursor mode at any time. But most of the time you'll want to be in Reticule mode.\n\nRight now you're on your Sanctuary, which is a safe-haven from enemies. Walk outside then proceed to the waypoint.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission2_04=The building in front of you is a HART center, which stands for High Altitude Rapid Transport. Go ahead and step inside\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission2_05=Now the types of equipment you can utilize is based on whatever certifications you possess. Certifications are effectively licenses to use equipment, such as weapons, body armor, vehicles, and support items - but how well you use them is still dependent on your own skill. Access one of the nearby Certification Terminals.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission2_06=As a brand new soldier, you only have a small amount of certification points, which are used to purchase certifications. Certifications vary in price, and you earn more certification points as you obtain higher Battle Ranks.\n\nTo obtain information about a certification, just select it. To purchase a certification, double-click on it. Feel free to view the various certifications, then purchase the Medium Assault certification. 
@OfflineMission2_07=Good. You can now obtain and utilize medium assault weaponry. Note that you can also sell back certifications to get your certification points back - so if you ever want to experiment with a certification, go right ahead.\n\nClose the Certification Terminal and access the nearby Equipment Terminal.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission2_08=The Equipment Terminal is divided into five tabs: Weapons, Body Armor, Support Items, Vehicle Ammunition, and Favorites. Go ahead and try left-clicking on all of them, then select the Weapons Tab again after looking at each.
@OfflineMission2_09=You'll notice there isn't much equipment under weapons, body armor, and support equipment. This is because as a new soldier, you lack certifications which enable you to obtain and utilize more advanced equipment. As you gain Battle Ranks through defeating enemies and capturing facilities, your Empire will reward you with certification points that you can spend on getting 'licensed' to use new types of equipment. When you obtain these certifications, the list of available items at the Equipment Terminal will grow.\n\nNow let's get you armed. Presently you have Standard Assault, which is what your Empire provided you with automatically, and Medium Assault, which you just purchased at the Equipment Terminal. Go ahead and double-click on the Punisher to obtain it.\n\n        Purchase Item - Double LMB\n
@OfflineMission2_10=When obtaining an item that you can equip, it will automatically be placed in the first available holster. If you don't have an empty holster, the item will then be placed in your backpack. Now get yourself the Automatic Machine Pistol (AMP) in the same manner.\n\n        Purchase Item - Double LMB\n
@OfflineMission2_11=You're catching on fast. Except right now you really don't need an AMP - that Suppressor will serve you fine. To remove an item from your inventory when accessing an Equipment Terminal, left-click once on the item. This will turn the mouse pointer into the respective item. Then left-click on the Return item button at the bottom of the Equipment Terminal.\n\nGo ahead and dispose of the AMP in this manner.\n\n        Purchase Item - Double LMB\n
@OfflineMission2_12=Whenever you obtain a weapon, it comes loaded with ammunition. However, you'll burn through a weapon's internal ammunition in no time, so it's always a good idea to get more. Next to the Suppressor are two ammo icons - the first is standard 9mm bullets, which are silver, and the second are armor-piercing 9mm bullets, which are gold.\n\nObtain three standard 9mm ammo boxes, and one armor-piercing 9mm ammo box.\n\n        Purchase Item - Double LMB\n
@OfflineMission2_13=Ammunition is always stored in the backpack, never in holsters. You still have a little bit of room left, so let's get you a MedKit. Select the Supplies Tab and grab a Medkit.\n\n        Purchase Item - Double LMB\n
@OfflineMission2_14=Good job - notice how the Medkit now appears on your Status bar function key! To use it, all you need to do is tap the respective function key. You've got yourself fairly well equipped. When you have a loadout that you like using, you can store it as a Favorite. Favorites allow for swift re-equipping at Equipment Terminals. Left-click on the Favorites Tab.
@OfflineMission2_15=Unlike the other tabs, which all deal with acquiring individual items, the Favorites Tab lets you recall full configurations. But first you need to set up some Favorites.\n\nAll of your Favorite slots are currently unused. Go ahead and left-click once on the first Favorite, then left-click on Save button at the bottom. When it prompts you to enter a name, type in a name then hit the Enter key.
@OfflineMission2_16=There you go! You have your first Favorite! Let's give it a try - in your Inventory pane, left-click on the "Clear Inventory" button and confirm it.
@OfflineMission2_17=Great. Now close the Equipment Terminal.\n\n        Close Equipment Terminal - Escape\n
@OfflineMission2_18=Once you've saved your first Favorite, the Favorites Tab will be the default menu whenever you access an Equipment Terminal. Go ahead and access the Equipment Terminal one more time.\n\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission2_19=Now that the Favorites Tab is your default menu, you can quickly and easily swap different configurations when accessing an Equipment Terminal. As you advance in Battle Rank and gain certifications, you'll want to create a number of Favorites to let you swiftly change between configurations. \n\nTo recall the earlier Favorite you saved, just press the number key next to it, or double-click on the Favorite.\n\n        Select Favorite Hot Key - 1\n        Select Favorite - Double LMB\n
@OfflineMission2_20=Whenever you recall a Favorite, the Equipment Terminal menu automatically closes. You'll want to set up a number of Favorites, especially as you earn more certifications. Favorites are essential in allowing you to quickly re-equip at Equipment Terminals. This concludes the exercise.

# Offline Mission 3
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission3_01=So you're ready to get your driver's license? Then let's get you rolling. There are a number of vehicles that you can obtain access to as you gain certifications. These include quads, assault buggies, tanks, gunships, armored personnel carriers, and even the massive Galaxy dropship.\n\nThis exercise will cover the basics in obtaining and driving a vehicle. Nearby is a vehicle pad with a vehicle terminal. You'll commonly find vehicle pads at your Sanctuary and facilities. Head over to the vehicle terminal and access it by facing the vehicle terminal and pressing the Action key.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission3_02=Ordinarily you need to possess the Harasser certification in order to obtain this vehicle, but for the purposes of bringing you up to speed we'll give you temporary access. To obtain the Harasser, double-click on the Harasser icon.\n\n        Purchase Item - Double LMB\n
@OfflineMission3_03=Whenever you manufacture a vehicle at a vehicle pad you need to immediately enter the driver's position and drive it off the vehicle pad. If you don't remove the vehicle within a short duration, it will automatically deconstruct to prevent the vehicle from becoming a traffic obstacle for other friendly soldiers attempting to obtain vehicles.\n\nTo board a vehicle, look for yellow mounting icons on the ground next to the vehicle. In this case, walk onto the yellow mounting icon next to the driver's seat and tap the Action key to hop into the vehicle.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission3_04=Nothing like the smell of a new car. Let's get this Harasser off the vehicle pad now.\n\n        Forward Acceleration - W\n        Reverse Acceleration - S\n        Turn Left - A\n        Turn Right - D\n
@OfflineMission3_05=Sorry to throw the brakes on, but it's a good idea to know a bit more about driving beyond simply pressing down on the accelerator. For example, presumably you don't want other friendlies 'borrowing' your ride without your permission.\n\nGo ahead and select the Vehicle Access Settings via the Soldier Management Menu- switch to Cursor mode, then left-click the Vehicle Access Settings, indicated by the small vehicle icon button.\n\n        Toggle Cursor Mode - Tab\n
@OfflineMission3_06=The Vehicle Access Settings lets you do a number of things. First and foremost, it lets you specify who can ride in the vehicle. You can choose to let any friendly from your Empire enter the vehicle, or you can restrict access to squads or Outfits, or lock it for your personal use only. You can also use it to kick unruly passengers out if they complain about your driving.\n\nClose the Vehicle Access Settings pane by clicking on the X in the upper-right.
@OfflineMission3_07=Now let's go over the other HUD elements that correspond to your vehicle. Next to your health, stamina, and armor is now your vehicle's health gauge. Similarly to the other gauges, as your vehicle is damaged, the gauge will decrease.\n\nNext to the Harasser icon is your speed gauge, which is measured in percentage of full throttle. Subsequently your speed is displayed from 0 to 100% throttle.\n\nThere are two ways to get around in a vehicle. The first is just to put the pedal to the metal, as you did when you drove off the vehicle pad. The second is to utilize the vehicle's cruise control settings. Cruise control allows finer control of the vehicle's speed by allowing you to set it to 10% increments. Then you can just focus on steering.\n\nLet's give cruise control a try. Set it to 50% and drive out of the facility's courtyard.\n\n        Forward Acceleration - W\n        50% Cruise Control - 5\n
@OfflineMission3_08=All right, time to set you loose. There are a series of waypoints you need to go through. You'll be informed when you reach the last waypoint. Go ahead and experiment with manually applying the gas as well as cruise control as you go through the various waypoints.\n\nYou may find it easier driving in chase camera. Feel free to switch between first-person and chase camera as you're tearing it up.\n\n        Forward Acceleration - W\n        Reverse Acceleration - S\n        Turn Left - A\n        Turn Right - D\n        Camera Toggle - T\n        10% Cruise Control - 1\n        20% Cruise Control - 2\n        30% Cruise Control - 3\n        40% Cruise Control - 4\n        50% Cruise Control - 5\n        60% Cruise Control - 6\n        70% Cruise Control - 7\n        80% Cruise Control - 8\n        90% Cruise Control - 9\n        100% Cruise Control - 0 or Q\n
@OfflineMission3_09=Congratulations, those waypoints didn't stand a chance against you. Before this exercise concludes, let's show you the trunk. Go ahead and exit the vehicle by tapping the Action key.\n\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission3_10=Now walk behind the vehicle and access the Harasser's trunk.\n\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission3_11=Most vehicles have trunks. This is where ammunition is stored for vehicular weapon systems. It also provides space to store extra equipment. If you run out of ammunition, you can obtain more ammunition at an Equipment Terminal, then just throw it into the trunk.\n\nThis concludes the Vehicle Handling exercise, soldier. If you want to do more experimenting with different vehicles, you can do so via the Virtual Training System on your Empire's Sanctuary.

# Offline Mission 4
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission4_01=It's time to learn how to get around, soldier. The continents we're fighting to control on Auraxis are large, and it's easy to get lost without a map. Fortunately we provide you with maps so you don't stumble into an enemy base asking for directions.\n\nThis exercise will train you in using the various maps provided to you. We'll start with the Proximity map, which displays up to a 200 meter local range. The directional arrow represents both your location and your facing.\n\nFriendly soldiers and vehicles will show up on the Proximity map. Enemy soldiers and vehicles won't always show up on radar unless they're detected by radar or a squadmate sees them. As covered in the first exercise, friendly units are teal on the Proximity, and enemy units are always red.\n\nYou can also adjust the radius of your Proximity map. Presently it's at 200 meters, which is a good range for when you're traveling across terrain. You can also decrease the radius, which is useful for keeping tightly grouped with squadmates, or navigating the interior of facilities. Go ahead and switch it to 50 meters then cycle back to 200.\n\n        Toggle Cursor Mode - Tab\n        Decrease Proximity Map - ]\n        Decrease Proximity Map - LMB\n        Increase Proximity Map - [\n        Increase Proximity Map - LMB\n
@OfflineMission4_02=There you go. While the Proximity map is ideal at showing your local area, there are two other map modes available to you that display tactical and global views. Let's switch to the Tactical Map view. Either click on the Map button in your Soldier Management Menu or press the hotkey to access the Tactical Map View.\n\n        Toggle Cursor Mode - Tab\n        Toggle Map View - M\n
@OfflineMission4_03=This shows you the full tactical view of the continent you're currently on. There's a lot going on here, so we'll go through it right now.\n\nFirst, you'll notice there are a number of colored spheres with names on top of them. These Spheres are known as Spheres of Influence, and they're each attached to a facility. The name on top of the Sphere of Influence represents the facility name, followed by the facility type. The color of the Sphere of Influence shows what Empire owns the facility.\n\nIt's very, very important that you understand what color represents what Empire. So let's go through that now.
@OfflineMission4_04=Blue Spheres of Influence represent New Conglomerate control.
@OfflineMission4_05=Red Spheres of Influence represent Terran Republic control.
@OfflineMission4_06=Purple Spheres of Influence represent Vanu Sovereignty control.
@OfflineMission4_07=Yellow Spheres of Influence represent neutral facilities.
@OfflineMission4_08=Warp Gates that connect the continents are also shown in this view. The name of the continent they connect to is on top of the respective Warp Gate.
@OfflineMission4_09=Another very important piece of information that the Tactical Map View provides you with are Hot Spots. These show you where your Empire is currently engaging the enemy. This allows you to get to the action faster.
@OfflineMission4_10=A Toolbar allows you to zoom in and out of the continent as well as toggle the different displays on and off. \n\nGo ahead and zoom into the continent.\n\n        Zoom Map - Mouse Wheel\n        Zoom In - Z\n
@OfflineMission4_11=Now to pan the view around, simply move the mouse pointer to the outer edge of the map screen in the direction you wish to pan. You can also use the arrow keys to pan.\n\n        Pan Map Up - Up Arrow\n        Pan Map Down - Down Arrow\n        Pan Map Left - Left Arrow\n        Pan Map Right - Right Arrow\n
@OfflineMission4_12=All right, now zoom back out to the full continent view.\n\n        Zoom Map - Mouse Wheel\n        Zoom In - X\n
@OfflineMission4_13=Good. Now's let go over the Global Map View, which is accessible via pressing the Global Map button on the toolbar. Switch to the Global Map View now.\n\n        Global View - G\n
@OfflineMission4_14=All of the battle continents as well as each Empire's Sanctuary are displayed in the Global Map View. Weather fronts and condensed HotSpot information are also displayed in this view.\n\nThe Global Map View also shows you a top-level network system for intercontinental travel. All of the continents are connected via Warpgates, and the Global Map View lets you see the corresponding connection points.\n\nThe vast majority of warp gates can be used by all Empires, and are neutral by default. However, each Empire's Sanctuary can only be traveled to and from by the respective Empire. These are known as Secure Warpgates, which we'll cover right now.
@OfflineMission4_15=This is the New Conglomerate Sanctuary. Its warp links are colored blue, and can only be used by the New Conglomerate.
@OfflineMission4_16=This is the Terran Republic Sanctuary. Its warp links are colored red, and can only be used by the Terran Republic.
@OfflineMission4_17=This is the Vanu Sovereignty Sanctuary. Its warp links are colored purple, and can only be used by the Vanu Sovereignty.
@OfflineMission4_18=The rest of the warp connections are neutral by default, and can be used by any Empire. You're currently on Hossin, a temperate continent. You're not too far from the Oshur Warpgate. Switch back to the Tactical Map View.\n\n        Tactical View - G\n
@OfflineMission4_19=All right, go ahead and place a waypoint on top of the Oshur Warpgate by right-clicking on it.
@OfflineMission4_20=Good. Exit the Tactical Map View.\n\n        Toggle Map View - M\n
@OfflineMission4_21=Now let's go ahead and use that Warpgate to go to Oshur. Run to the waypoint you placed on the Warpgate.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission4_22=All Warpgates have protective umbrellas around them. Due to the spatial energy within the warpgate, no weapons can be utilized within the umbrella - they're effectively safe zones.\n\nThe actual warp core at the center of the umbrella is the actual teleportation mechanism. Go ahead and run into it - don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission4_23=Fantastic. You got a small taste of just how large the world is in this exercise, and how vital the map modes can be in navigating your way. Be sure to familiarize yourself with using them as much as possible when you're out on the battlefield.


# Offline Mission 5
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission5_01=There are two ways to accomplish intercontinental travel. The first method is by traveling through the warpgates, which were covered under the Map Usage exercise. The second way is by utilizing Drop Pods.\n\nOn each Empire's Sanctuary there are High Altitude Rapid Transports - otherwise known as HARTs - that allow soldiers to deploy to continents via atmospheric Drop Pods. This exercise will show you how to board a HART and deploy to a continent via Drop Pod.\n\nYou'll notice a HART information pane that shows when the next HART is arriving, and when it's boarding. Head into a HART Center as indicated by the waypoint.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission5_02=The HART Center is where you can board a HART when it's docked. Fortunately HARTs arrive and depart on a regular basis.\n\nAlso located within the HART Center are Certification Terminals, Implant Terminals, and Equipment Terminals. As you gain Battle Ranks, you'll find that you can specialize your character at both Certification and Implant Terminals. The Equipment Terminals let you suit up before taking off.\n\nWhen the HART is docked, the door will open. Simply walk into it to board the HART. After you board the HART and the boarding process ends, the HART will lift off. As it reaches the upper atmosphere, you'll be presented with the Drop Pod menu.\n\nGo ahead and board the HART when the door is open.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission5_03=The Drop Pod menu uses the same Global and Tactical Map Views that were covered under the Map Usage exercise. You're first presented with the Global Map View so you can select a destination. Double-click on Hossin to select it.
@OfflineMission5_04=If you change your mind about the continent, you can always click on the Global Map View button on the Toolbar to return to the Global Map View to select a different continent. But let's stick with Hossin for the time being.\n\nTo select a Drop Pod landing zone, simply left-click on the desired drop zone. Note, however, that some landing zones are illegal. These include hazards, such as water, as well as Spheres of Influence. Go ahead and place a landing zone.
@OfflineMission5_05=Now the only thing left to do is click on the Launch button. Once you click on the Launch button, there's no turning back - you'll be immediately launched.\n\nPress the Launch button.
@OfflineMission5_06=Quite a ride, eh? That's about it. Using a Drop Pod is pretty straightforward, but again, they're only available at your Empire's Sanctuary. And while they're effective at getting into the action fast, the drawback is you can't bring vehicles with you, as you can when traveling via warpgates. So exercise caution when using drop pods, as it's quite possible to drop into a nest of enemies. This concludes the Drop Pod exercise.


# Offline Mission 6
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission6_01=You've been doing great, soldier. This key to winning this war is all about capturing facilities and pushing our enemies back. So it's time to show you how to capture a facility.\n\nNearby is Ghanon, a Technology Plant. Run up to the waypoint take a look at it.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission6_02=Right now Ghanon is neutral. There are two ways to tell that it's neutral. The first way is via the Tactical Map View. Go ahead and switch to the Tactical Map View.\n\n        Toggle Map View - M\n
@OfflineMission6_03=You'll note that Ghanon's Sphere of Influence is yellow, meaning it's neutral. Recall from earlier that the color of the Spheres of Influence represent which Empire owns it. A quick recap is blue Spheres of Influence are the New Conglomerate, Red Spheres of Influence are the Terran Republic, and Purple Spheres of Influence are the Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nHowever, in this case, you didn't really have to switch to the Tactical Map View to know that this facility is neutral. Close the Tactical Map View.\n\n        Toggle Map View - M\n
@OfflineMission6_04=When you're this close to a facility, you can tell who owns the facility by simply looking at the defensive wall. When an Empire owns it, the Empire's color is shown on the wall.\n\nFor example...
@OfflineMission6_05=This is what the facility would look like if it was owned by the New Conglomerate. A blue band appears on the defensive wall.
@OfflineMission6_06=This is what the facility would look like if it was owned by the Terran Republic. A red band appears on the defensive wall.
@OfflineMission6_07=And this is what the facility would look like if it was owned by the Vanu Sovereignty. A purple band appears on the defensive wall.
@OfflineMission6_08=And now it's back to being neutral. To capture a facility, you need to have a Remote Electronics Kit - otherwise known as the REK. These can be commonly obtained at Equipment Terminals under the Supplies Tab.\n\nYou'll notice that you have a REK in your first holster. Press the number to equip it.\n\n        Equip REK - 1\n
@OfflineMission6_09=For the purposes of this exercise, we'll go ahead and have this facility belong to an enemy Empire. Now proceed to the next waypoint.
@OfflineMission6_10=To the right side of the door is a door terminal. When a facility is owned by an enemy, you need to temporarily unlock the door by hacking the Door Terminal. Target the door terminal with the REK and hold down the primary fire key.\n\n        Fire (Use REK) - LMB\n
@OfflineMission6_11=Good job. That temporarily disables the Identify Friend or Foe functionality of the door terminal, allowing yourself and others to pass through the door. Door locks are one way - only to prevent enemies from getting in. Once you're inside, you can leave at any time.\n\nNow follow the next series of waypoints.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission6_12=Another pesky door lock. Vital locations within a facility, such as the generator room, barracks, and control console, all have door locks to provide extra security for the defenders. Go ahead and unlock this door like you did before then proceed to the control console.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Fire (Use REK) - LMB\n
@OfflineMission6_13=Ah, the control console. This is the heart of the facility in determining who owns it. Capturing a facility is a two-step process. The first part involves hacking the control console itself. It's much like breaching doors, except it takes longer. Go ahead and hack the control console.\n\n        Fire (Use REK) - LMB\n
@OfflineMission6_14=You'll note that it takes some time to complete the first step. This can be reduced by spending certification points on hacking certifications. Regardless, it's a good idea to have friendlies covering your back when you're hacking, otherwise you're an easy kill for an enemy.\n\nNow even though you've hacked the facility, it isn't yours yet. When you hack a facility, it still belongs to whichever Empire owned it when you first hacked it. This is where Step 2 comes into play - you need to make sure that the present owner doesn't resecure it while a countdown timer elapses. Subsequently you need to defend the control console. Now in this case, the facility is neutral, but most of the time you'll be hacking facilities that do belong to enemy Empires.\n\nThis is another good reason to have squadmates helping you to defend the control console. If you successfully prevent the other Empires from hacking the control console and the timer elapses, the facility transfers to your Empire. You and your squadmates will also earn valuable experience points for gaining additional ranks.\n\nThis concludes the facility capture exercise.

# Offline Mission 7
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission7_01=You've been doing great so far, soldier. Now it's time to learn a bit more about what keeps facilities up and running.\n\nAll facilities require energy in order to remain operational. This energy comes in the form of Nanite Technology Units - or NTU for short. Each facility has a NTU Silo that stores this energy in its courtyard. You're presently facing one of these NTU Silos.\n\nThis NTU Silo is providing power to this facility. The gauge on the NTU Silo lets you know how much energy is remaining within the respective NTU Silo. If the gauge completely dissipates, the facility will become neutral, and all of its functionality is taken offline. Presently this facility belongs to you, but this NTU Silo doesn't have much energy remaining.\n\nYou can also reference NTU Silo levels at other friendly facilities via the Tactical Map View. Go ahead and access the Tactical Map View now. 
@OfflineMission7_02=The numbers next to each friendly facility represent the amount of NTU remaining at the respective facility. The Tactical Map View is useful for quickly referencing the amount of NTU at all friendly facilities on a continent. Enemy facilities do not readily display the amount of NTU they have remaining on the Tactical Map View.\n\nLooks like your facility is running really low on NTU - let's remedy that. Close the Tactical Map View.
@OfflineMission7_03=In order to resupply a facility's NTU Silo, you first need to collect the energy. This is where a special purpose vehicle known as the Advanced Nanite Transport - or ANT for short - comes into play.\n\nSince it's pivotal that facilities are resupplied within energy as often as possible, your Empire automatically provides you with the ANT certification.\n\nProceed to the Vehicle Pad and access the Vehicle Terminal.
@OfflineMission7_04=All right, there's the ANT on the menu. Remember, after you purchase the ANT, immediately get into the driver's position and drive it off the Vehicle Pad. Now double-click on the ANT to obtain it, then mount the ANT and drive it out of the facility's courtyard.
@OfflineMission7_05=Looks like you got that ANT just in time! If the facility had become neutral before you had obtained the ANT, you wouldn't have been able to obtain it here.\n\nThe downside is the facility no longer belongs to your Empire, as it's now neutral. In order for an Empire to own a facility, the facility must have NTU in its NTU Silo. Now a facility can be hacked while the NTU Silo is empty, during which time the NTU Silo can be resupplied. As long as there's NTU in the NTU Silo when the capture timer elapses, the facility will be successfully captured. If not, the capture will fail. Let's go ahead and hack the control terminal, then go about resupplying this facility. \n\nExit the vehicle then run up the nearby stairwell. The control console for this particular facility is located on the roof. Proceed to the waypoint.
@OfflineMission7_06=Now equip the REK like you did in the last exercise and hack the control console.
@OfflineMission7_07=Notice the warning? Now you have to resupply this facility's NTU Silo before the capture timer elapses, or the capture attempt will fail. Run back to the ANT and jump into the driver's seat.
@OfflineMission7_08=Whenever an ANT is first obtained at a Vehicle Terminal, it has no NTU. Refer to the Ready pane and it will show you that your ANT presently has zero NTU. Fortunately NTU can be collected within a Warp Gate's umbrella. Follow the waypoints down the road to the nearby Warp Gate. Remember you can switch to chase-camera when driving.\n\n        Camera Toggle - T\n
@OfflineMission7_09=There's nothing like being within the protective confines of a Warp Gate's umbrella. The spatial energy you're going to collect here interferes with weaponry, so while you're within the umbrella you're completely safe.\n\nIt's time to load the ANT with NTU. Go ahead and exit the ANT.\n\n        Exit Vehicle - G\n
@OfflineMission7_10=In order to collect the NTU that's present within the Warp Gate's umbrella, you first need to deploy the ANT. Walk to the back of the ANT and onto the deploy circle then tap the Action key to deploy it.
@OfflineMission7_11=Good job. Now the ANT will continue to collect NTU until it's either fully loaded or you manually undeploy it. However, we want the ANT to be fully loaded, so let's wait for it to finish collecting NTU.
@OfflineMission7_12=Great. Whenever an ANT collects a full load of NTU, the ANT automatically undeploys itself. The ANT is now ready to resupply the facility's NTU Silo. Go ahead and hop back into the driver's seat.\n\n        Enter Vehicle - G\n
@OfflineMission7_13=Before you take off to resupply the facility, take a quick look at the Status bar. You'll notice the ANT is carrying a full load of NTU now.
@OfflineMission7_14=Let's get you back to resupply that facility's NTU Silo. Follow the waypoints back to the facility.
@OfflineMission7_15=One quick note before you head into the courtyard… In order to resupply a facility's NTU Silo, you must first park then deploy the ANT within 20 meters of the NTU Silo. This will automatically start to resupply the facility. Keep in mind you can only resupply friendly or neutral facilities.\n\nAlso, you might want to use a slower cruise control setting when driving within a facility's courtyard - that will lessen the chance to run into walls and other obstacles. Go ahead and follow the remaining waypoints at 50% cruise control.
@OfflineMission7_16=All right, you're within resupply range of the NTU Silo. Go ahead and exit the ANT.\n\n        Exit Vehicle - G\n
@OfflineMission7_17=Now deploy the ANT again - just like you did when you were collecting NTU at the Warp Gate. 
@OfflineMission7_18=Nicely done - the ANT is now resupplying the NTU Silo with NTU that it collected from the Warp Gate. This process continues unless you manually undeploy the ANT, the ANT is destroyed, or the NTU Silo is completely filled. We want the NTU Silo to be completely filled, so just sit back and watch the gauge on the NTU Silo fill to capacity. 
@OfflineMission7_19=The NTU Silo is now completely filled! As an added bonus, you earn Battle Experience Points for resupplying a NTU Silo with NTU.
@OfflineMission7_20=Excellent! Because you resupplied the NTU Silo, your capture of the facility was successful! Great job!\n\nNow before this exercise concludes, step back into the driver's seat of the ANT.\n\n        Enter Vehicle - G\n
@OfflineMission7_21=Take a quick look at the Ready pane. You'll notice that the ANT used up a fair amount of NTU when resupplying the facility.\n\nSubsequently ANTs need to commonly reload at Warp Gates in order to keep friendly facilities up and running.\n\nWhile there are a number of fellow soldiers who will regularly aid in resupplying facilities, do your part and resupply facilities that you see running low on power. It benefits both you and your Empire when you do so.\n\nAnd that concludes this exercise.

# Offline Mission 8
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@OfflineMission8_01=This exercise will cover the inevitable, soldier - death. Even if you're at the top of your game, you're bound to get killed. Fortunately alien technology was discovered decades ago that allows the preservation of a soldier's genetic pattern. Subsequently when you die, this rebirthing technology brings you back to life and into the action in no time.\n\nPresently it appears that you're in the middle of nowhere. Since your Empire needs you in the action as much as possible, they've modified the rebirthing technology to allow it to effectively teleport you to hotspots - basically areas where combat with enemies is occurring.\n\nTo utilize this, simply access the Options menu and select Instant Action. Go ahead and try it. \n\n        Options Menu - Escape\n
@OfflineMission8_02=When you select Instant Action, you're randomly assigned to a hotspot. You're presently at Ogma, a Bio Lab on the continent Forseral. Go ahead and step out of the Respawn Tube.\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission8_03=Take a look at the Respawn Tube you just exited. Whenever you're killed in battle and choose to respawn, you'll appear within a Respawn Tube.\n\nThere's a small matrix panel on the Respawn Tube. Go ahead and target the matrix panel and press the action key\n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission8_04=What you just did was manually bound yourself to this facility. Now when you die, regardless of your location, you'll be able to choose this facility as a Respawn location.\n\nNow let's see what's happening at this facility. Proceed to the nearest door. \n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission8_05=Ouch! Well, that's one of the dangers in choosing Instant Action - you're literally dropped into a hot zone. However, we'll use this opportunity to cover the Respawn Menu, which you'll undoubtedly be seeing often.\n\nNotice you're looking at the Tactical Map View. Whenever you die, the available Respawn locations on your present continent are highlighted on the Tactical Map View. In this case, your available Respawn locations on this continent include this facility as well an Advanced Mobile Station located South of Gwydion.\n\nYour Sanctuary is always available as a Respawn location as well. Whenever a Respawn location is on a different continent, it's displayed within its own small window like the Sanctuary is presently shown.\n\nNow spawning at this facility isn't a good idea - that enemy Mechanized Assault ExoSuit will just tear you apart again. So go ahead and click on the Advanced Mobile Station that's south of Gwydion. 
@OfflineMission8_06=Now you're at the Advanced Mobile Station that you saw on the Tactical Map View. Go ahead and proceed to the waypoint. \n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission8_07=This is a good opportunity to cover the Advanced Mobile Station, often referred to as AMS for short. The AMS is an extremely useful mobile base. In addition to the AMS acting as a Respawn point, the AMS also has an equipment terminal on the back that lets you get fully equipped after respawning. 
@OfflineMission8_08=But that's not all that makes the AMS special - proceed to the next waypoint. \n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission8_09=What really makes the AMS useful is that it emits a cloaking field. The AMS and anyone within its cloaking field are fully concealed from view. Likewise, when you're within the cloaking field, you're concealed from anyone outside of it, but you can't see them through the cloaking field, either. To see other soldiers or vehicles, you need to be on the same side of the cloaking field.  This makes the AMS extremely effective at deploying nearby enemy facilities to commence an attack.\n\nNote, however, that the cloaking field is not a shield - projectiles will pass through it just as readily as if the AMS were visible. 
@OfflineMission8_10=Head back into the AMS's cloaking field. \n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission8_11=And now you can see the AMS again. The key to the AMS's functionality is whether it's deployed or not. When it's deployed, as it is now, the respawn tubes, equipment terminal, and cloaking field are active. However, to drive the AMS, it must be undeployed, which deactivates the respawn tubes, equipment terminal, and cloaking field.\n\nGo ahead and walk to the front of the AMS and onto the deploy circle then undeploy it. \n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission8_12=Now the AMS can be driven again. Again, when undeployed, the respawn tubes and equipment terminal aren't available for use. The cloaking field is also disabled, so the AMS is now visibly exposed. This isn't a good location for the AMS to be exposed...
@OfflineMission8_13=Maybe that wasn't the best time to undeploy that AMS. You're back to seeing the Tactical Map View and current Respawn options.\n\nTo try to keep you near the fight, the nearest friendly locations are always available as Respawn locations. In this case, your nearest Respawn options are Neit, a facility west of Gwydion, and a Gun Tower that's located just north of Gwydion. Because you manually bound yourself at Ogma earlier, it's also available as a location. You can only be manually bound at one facility. And the Sanctuary is available.\n\nSelect the Gun Tower. 
@OfflineMission8_14=You just respawned at the Gun Tower you selected. Go ahead and step out of the Respawn Tube. \n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n
@OfflineMission8_15=Gun Towers are much smaller facilities that are useful chokepoints or fallback locations.\n\nRespawn Tubes also act as teleporters. Step back into the Respawn Tube and choose the deconstruct option. \n\n        Auto Run - Q\n        Forward - W\n        Backward - S\n        Step Left - A\n        Step Right - D\n        Jump - Space\n        Crouch - Ctrl or C\n        Walk - Shift\n        Action - G\n
@OfflineMission8_16=Don't worry; you weren't killed this time. When you choose to deconstruct in a Respawn Tube, your standard Respawn options appear via the Tactical Map View. Subsequently you can use Respawn Tubes as teleporters. Go ahead and select Ogma. 
@OfflineMission8_17=And now you're back to Ogma.\n\nNow before this exercise is concluded, we'll cover one more feature - returning to your Sanctuary. You can return to your Sanctuary at any time by accessing the Options menu and selecting the Recall to Sanctuary option. This is useful if you want to group up with friends back at the Sanctuary, or if you want to log out from a safe location. Go ahead and access the Options menu then select Recall to Sanctuary. \n\n        Options Menu - Escape\n
@OfflineMission8_18=You're back within the safe confines of your Sanctuary, soldier.  You've done a great job in these training exercises. Now it's time to get out there and serve your Empire!
