@E1=Terran Republic
@E2=New Conglomerate
@E3=Vanu Sovereignty

@E0Description=GENERAL BACKGROUND\n\nIn existence for over a thousand years, the Terran Republic was the sole governing power with an intergalactic reign. Largely militant in its rule, the Terran Republic nonetheless maintained absolute authority until recently when an expeditionary force was sent into a wormhole to colonize a newly discovered world named Auraxis.\n\nDuring the course of colonizing Auraxis, three Main Bases were established at different locations on the planet's surface to expedite the colonization. In the following years numerous outposts were constructed across Auraxis' continents.\n\nRemnants of an ancient alien race were also unearthed, and this race became known as the Vanu. No traces of what happened to the Vanu could ever be found, but elements of their technology were discovered during the colonization stages, most notably ‘rebirthing' technology. Utilizing a hybrid of man-made and Vanu technology, humans were able to store their genetic pattern. Whenever someone died, the person would be able to come back to life via the rebirthing technology.\n\nNear the end of the colonization period, the wormhole collapsed, stranding the Terran Republic expedition from the main Empire. Tensions grew and escalated. Emboldened now that the main body of the Empire was cut off, the Terran Republic was ultimately divided into three Empires: those still allied with Terran Republic, and two new empires - the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nNow the three Empires are engaged in a world-wide war for control of Auraxis. A war without permanent death.
@E1Description=TERRAN REPUBLIC\n\nThe Terran Republic's focus is to re-establish its authority as a single governing body. While the Terran Republic is actively engaged in an official state of war against those that seceded into the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty, the goal is to reunite everyone under the Terran Republic once again.\n\nThe traditionalists that comprise the Terran Empire are both embarrassed and outraged by the secessions, and strive to regain control as quickly as possible. This is partially to re-establish a single order, but also in fear of the wormhole re-opening and facing punitive measures for allowing the secessions to happen in the first place.\n\nTerran Republic equipment relies largely on speed, with an emphasis on fast-firing weaponry. Their weaponry lacks the punching power on an individual shot basis in comparison to the New Conglomerate, but they make up for it with an extremely fast refire rate. Likewise for their vehicles, which rely on delivering as many projectiles within a short timeframe as possible.
@E2Description=NEW CONGLOMERATE\n\nThe New Conglomerate was formed by soldiers that felt the Terran Republic was too militant, and in many ways ancient, in its governing practices. While many felt oppressed, the sheer size and scope of the Terran Republic Empire was a definitive silencing factor. Subsequently when the wormhole collapsed, it wasn't long before a number of soldiers began openly questioning and criticizing the Terran Republic ways. And in short order a violent revolution occurred in which the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty formed.\n\nSeeking to distance themselves as much as possible from the Terran Republic's traditional government, the New Conglomerate seeks a freer society. In doing so the New Conglomerate soldiers combat the Terran Republic to defend against becoming re-acquired, and fight the Vanu Sovereignty who are trying to monopolize the planet's alien technology.\n\nThe New Conglomerate focus on hitting as hard as possible. Many of their weapons deliver the most damage on a per shot basis, but lack the refiring rate of the Terran Republic. Likewise their vehicles are extremely powerful, but don't possess the agile handling of the Vanu Sovereignty.
@E3Description=VANU SOVEREIGNTY\n\nAt the same time the New Conglomerate seceded from the Terran Republic, the Vanu Sovereignty was also formed. Unlike the New Conglomerate, which simply wanted more freedom, and the Terran Republic, which was fighting to regain control, the Vanu Sovereignty embraced the alien Vanu technology found on Auraxis, going so far as to name themselves the Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nThe Vanu Sovereignty believes that being cut off from the main Terran Republic Empire was a blessing, allowing them to officially separate and form their own Empire to unearth and utilize Vanu technology. They view the Terran Republic with open disdain, and don't trust the New Conglomerate's ‘freer' society motivation. Ultimately, they feel that neither of the opposing Empires understands the true potential of the Vanu technology, and therefore the Vanu Sovereignty openly combats the New Conglomerate and Terran Republic in an effort to preserve and control all discovered Vanu technology.\n\nUnlike the New Conglomerate and Terran Republic, which have more traditionally-based weaponry and vehicles, the Vanu Sovereignty has ‘interpreted' Vanu science into hybrids of man-made and Vanu technology, examples of which consist largely of energy-based weaponry and hover vehicles.

# Equipment Terminal Descriptions
#---------------------------------------------------------
# WEAPONS
# <standard assault>
@ilc9_info=The AMP is designed for close-range combat. It is the only rapid-fire pistol and can empty a full clip extremely quickly. However, it suffers from  poor recoil, causing it to be very inaccurate when fired beyond a close range.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@repeater_info=The primary sidearm for the Terran Republic is the Repeater pistol. As with all Terran Republic technology, the Repeater's design focuses on a swift firing rate and good ammo base. What the Repeater lacks in power it makes up with these attributes.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@suppressor_info=An effective, light-weight, and compact submachine gun, the Suppressor is a solid close-quarters weapon. And with its low recoil, it's easy to aim and utilize in combat.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@isp_info=Essentially a handheld shotgun pistol, the Scatter Pistol is primarily designed for close quarter combat. Due to its short barrel design, the Scatter Pistol isn't very effective beyond close range.\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@beamer_info=The Beamer is the primary sidearm of Vanu Sovereingty soldiers. It is a high power/short range energy weapon, capable of inflicting notable damage on enemy soldiers. The primary drawback the Beamer suffers from is degradation of the beam's power over range, resulting in weaker hits at long distances.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <medium assault>
@cycler_info=The Cycler is the fastest firing assault rifle. It is also equipped with an enhanced magnification of four times, allowing it to effectively target distant enemies. It uses a cylinder drum for its ammunition source.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@flechette_info=Built on standard shotgun technology, the Sweeper fires a burst of slugs which are capable of piercing MAX armor at close range. Subsequently it's a useful weapon not only against soldiers, but light vehicles as well.\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@punisher_info=The Punisher is a well-rounded assault rifle that incorporates not just a standard automatic firing mode, but comes equipped with a launcher that is capable of firing either rocklets or grenades. Its standard firing mode delivers reliable short to medium range combat capability.\nWhile it can effectively reach long range, its limited zooming makes aiming effectively somewhat of a hindrance.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).\nSecondary mode uses either rocklets, fragmentation grenades, plasma grenades, or jammer grenades.
@gauss_info=Using magnetic field technology, the Gauss assault rifle combines standard combustion-based ammunition with a magnetic field that boosts the actual projectile speed when fired. This allows the Gauss to use standard ammunition more effectively than other assault rifles.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@pulsar_info=The Pulsar automatic assault rifle is a highly effective weapon utilized by the Vanu Sovereignty. With minimum recoil due to its energy-based technology, the Pulsar can be devastating at short to medium range.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <sniper>
@bolt_driver_info=The Bolt Driver is a powerful sniper rifle and is capable of killing lightly armored enemy soldiers in a single shot. It suffers from only being able to load a single bolt at a time, thus requiring reloading after every shot.\nAmmo: Bolt.

# <heavy assault>
@mini_chaingun_info=The Mini Chaingun is a heavy assault machine gun that is designed to rapidly spit out rounds from a generous ammo base. While not particularly damaging per shot, the sheer speed at which it fires can easily rip apart an enemy soldier.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@r_shotgun_info=Utilizing magnetic technology to further accelerate its projectiles, the Jackhammer is a heavy assault shotgun. With a good ammunition capacity and reasonable fire rate, the Jackhammer is the New Conglomerate's primary heavy assault weapon.\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@lasher_info=The Lasher fires a special concentrated energy 'orb' that lashes out against any soldiers or vehicles at close range as it moves past them. The damage it delivers is variable, based on whether it actually hits a target or simply lashes it. A target that is lashed may receive several minor damage hits, while a target that is directly impacted by the orb receives a single large impact.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <anti-vehicular>
@hunterseeker_info=The Phoenix uses wire-guided technology to allow the operator to literally fly the missile into the intended target. As soon as the missile is fired, the operator switches to a camera mounted on the tip of the warhead. While the missile is in flight, the operator can either directly fly the missile to impact, or press the primary fire key anytime during flight to detonate the warhead immediately (in case of a near miss).\nAmmo: Phoenix missile.
@striker_info=The Striker serves as the Terran Republic's main anti-vehicular missile launcher. In standard firing mode, it launches a dumbfire missile where it's aimed. When in secondary mode, the Striker will attempt to lock-on to an armored target (heavy assault suit, vehicle, or turret) as long as the reticule is kept on the target for a short duration. Once lock-on is achieved, a lock-on confirmation is displayed, along with a confirmation tone. At this point tapping the primary fire key will launch the missile and it will home in on the respective target.\nAmmo: Striker missile.
@lancer_info=The Lancer is a shoulder-mounted beam weapon that the Vanu Sovereignty utilize in combating enemy vehicles. It is specifically designed to inflict high damage versus armored targets.\nAmmo: Lancer cartridge.

# <special assault>
@rocklet_info=The Rocklet Gun carries a small payload of rocklets which are effective up to medium range. Each rocklet delivers a reasonably powerful explosive force. It possesses no guidance capabilities making it a dumbfire projectile. When in secondary mode, pressing the trigger launches all rocklets in rapid succession, emptying the weapon of any remaining rocklets.\nAmmo: Rocket pod.
@thumper_info=A standard grenade launcher, the Thumper can lob grenades to a medium range and can be used for indirect fire.\nAmmo: Fragmentation, jammer, or plasma Grenade Packs.
@phoenix_info=The Decimator is an extremely powerful missile launcher utilizing a disposable design; once all three of its pre-loaded shots are fired, the Decimator launcher is useless and discarded. In standard mode, the Decimator is a dumbfire missile launcher.\n\nAmmo: Built-in (fire and forget after three shots)

# AMMUNITION
# <hand-held ammo>
@9mmbullet_info=The standard bullet used in most projectile weapons, this ammunition is best against 'soft' targets.
@9mmbullet_AP_info=This armor-piercing ammunition penetrates the heavier armor of vehicles, MAXs, and equipment such as terminals, generators, and deployables.
@shotgun_shell_info=The standard shell for all shotgun-based weapons, this cartridge is best used against 'soft' targets.
@shotgun_shell_AP_info=This armor-piercing shotgun slug penetrates the heavier armor of vehicles, MAXs, and equipment such as terminals, generators, and deployables.
@rocket_info=This ammunition fits into all weapons that utilize small rockets. Although slow-moving, it delivers a hard localized explosion to its target.
@frag_cartridge_info=This fragmentation grenade ammunition delivers explosive concussion to its target.
@plasma_cartridge_info=The plasma grenade explodes and splashes intense plasma on a target, burning it continuously over a period of time after the explosion.
@jammer_cartridge_info=The jammer grenade causes loss of power to many systems in its area of effect. This includes loss of power to turrets, motion sensors, the resetting of implant timers on soldiers in that area, and disruption of radar.
@bolt_info=The large caliber round used by the Bolt Driver sniper rifle.
@striker_missile_ammo_info=The unique missile required for the Striker missile launcher.
@hunter_seeker_missile_info=The ammunition used in the New Conglomerate Phoenix launcher.
@energy_cell_info=These energy cells are used in all Vanu Sovereignty beam-type weapons except the Lancer.
@lancer_cartridge_info=This large-capacity energy cell powers the Lancer anti-vehicular energy beam.

# <heavy armor ammo>
@burster_ammo_info=The 'flak' cannon ammunition used by a MAX designed to be used on enemy aircraft.
@dualcycler_ammo_info=The large-caliber ammunition used by a MAX to tear apart 'soft' targets and chip away at more armored ones.
@pounder_ammo_info=The indirect grenade ammunition used by a MAX.
@sparrow_ammo_info=These missiles can lock and home in on enemy aircraft. Used by a Sparrow MAX.
@scattercannon_ammo_info=This tri-pattern heavy shotgun can be set to wide spread (with a short range), average spread (with a medium range), or tight spread (with a long range).
@falcon_ammo_info=This dumbfire missile launcher packs a heavy punch and is best used against heavily armored targets.
@starfire_ammo_info=These small plasma spheres can track enemy aircraft, home in, and splash burn those vehicles.
@quasar_ammo_info=Effectively, a very heavy version of the Pulsar assault rifle, the Quasar fills the anti-infantry role on the battlefield.
@comet_ammo_info=Shooting spheres of energy plasma that explode around the target area causing aggravated damage to all within that area. This weapon is particularly suited to destroying ground vehicles.

# <equipment ammo>
@armor_canister_info=Armor canisters are used by BANK devices, as well as Nano-dispensers and are used to repair damage to armor and mechanical devices.
@health_canister_info=Health canisters are used by medical applicators and are used to regenerate the Health of living tissue.

# <vehicle ammo>
@105mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 100 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the 100 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFProwler\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe 100 mm Cannon lacks the power of the 150 mm Cannon, but enjoys a faster refire rate and moderate recoil penalties.
@12mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 12 mm Rotary Chaingun.\nThe following vehicles use the 12 mm Rotary Chaingun:\n\\#00FFFFBasilisk, Harasser, Lightning, Marauder, Mosquito, Prowler\n\n\\#FFFFFFDesigned primarily as an anti-infantry weapon, the Rotary Chaingun is a high-speed machine gun capable of projecting rounds at an extremely fast rate. While each round itself does little damage, the refire rate more than compensates, and the Rotary Chaingun is capable of delivering damage through aggregate means. The Rotary Chaingun does suffer from recoil, however, and firing in full automatic mode can easily reduce accuracy - it's ideally suited for firing in bursts at close to medium range.
@150mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 150 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the 150 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFVanguard\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe most powerful anti-vehicular cannon on a per shot basis, the 150 mm Cannon combines devastating power, proximity damage, and long range capabilities to make it an ideal anti-tank weapon. The 150 mm does suffer from a poor refire rate, but is nonetheless the king of vehicular cannons.
@20mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon.\nThe following vehicles use the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFDeliverer, Galaxy, Reaver, Vanguard\n\n\\#FFFFFFWhile the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon doesn't have the blazing refire rate found on other machine gun class weapons such as the Rotary Chaingun, it nonetheless makes up with increased damage per shot and improved accuracy. The 20 mm Recoilless Cannon can be used effectively against infantry as well as lightly armored vehicles even over long range.
@75mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 75 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicles use the 75 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFLightning, Sunderer\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe 75 mm Cannon launches explosive shells that inflict heavy damage against vehicles and moderate damage against infantry. A reasonable refire rate gives the 75 mm a somewhat balanced role as both anti-vehicular and anti-infantry. Each shell is explosive and damages a small area effect.
@pulse_particle_accelerator_info=Ammunition for the Pulse Particle Accelerator.\nThe following vehicle uses the Pulse Particle Accelerator:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially an automatic laser machine gun. The individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic. The pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they dissipate. As with the Rotary Chaingun and 20 mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@pulse_battery_info=Ammunition for the Pulse Particle Accelerator.\nThe following vehicle uses the Pulse Particle Accelerator:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially an automatic laser machine gun. The individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic. The pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they dissipate. As with the Rotary Chaingun and 20 mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@proximity_mine_info=The Proximity Mine is extremely powerful, designed primarily as an anti-vehicular weapon.
@groundpounder_info=Ammunition for the GroundPounder Heavy Grenade Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the GroundPounder:\n\\#00FFFFMarauder\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe GroundPounder inflicts most of its damage through proximity radius. When fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases in a linear manner to the proximity's edge. Due to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@heavy_grenade_mortar_info=Ammunition for the GroundPounder Heavy Grenade Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the GroundPounder:\n\\#00FFFFMarauder\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe GroundPounder inflicts most of its damage through proximity radius. When fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases in a linear manner to the proximity's edge. Due to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@fluxcannon_info=Ammunition for the Flux Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the Flux Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFThresher\n\n\\#FFFFFFConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies. While an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75 mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate. When fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@flux_cannon_thresher_battery_info=Ammunition for the Flux Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the Flux Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFThresher\n\n\\#FFFFFFConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies. While an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75 mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate. When fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@railbeam_info=Ammunition for the Rail Beam.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rail Beam:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFExtremely precise and powerful, the Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects. The Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@heavy_rail_beam_battery_info=Ammunition for the Rail Beam.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rail Beam:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFExtremely precise and powerful, the Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects. The Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@firebird_missile_info=Ammunition for the Firebird Rocket Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Firdbird Rocket Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFEnforcer\n\n\\#FFFFFFLaunching potent rockets at a fairly rapid rate, the Firebird is extremely useful when mounted on mobile armor.\n\nThe refire rate is average, but each rocket delivers both solid damage and a reasonable proximity effect when exploding.\n\nThe projectiles travel at a fairly swift rate when launched, but are best used against close- to medium-range vehicular targets. Targets at longer ranges can generally undertake evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit by a Firebird rocket.
@reaver_rocket_info=Ammunition for the Rocket Pod Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rocket Pod Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFReaver\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe Rocket Pod Launcher swiftly dispenses a solid payload of small dumbfire rockets. Due to the dumbfire nature of the rockets, it's most effectively used at close range, where both soldiers and vehicles alike can become victims of direct hits or the collective splash damage.

# ARMOR TYPES
@standard_issue_armor_info=This is the standard vest armor and uniform distributed to your Empire. It gives little protection...but at least keeps the wind out. It has one pistol holster and one back attachment for a rifle-sized weapon.
@lite_armor_info=This Agile Armor is designed to give the greatest flexibility and speed advantages to its wearer. It has two pistol holsters and an attachment for a back-mounted weapon as well.
@med_armor_info=This Reinforced Armor is much tougher than other armors, but at the expense of some mobility. It has two hip holsters, as well as two back attachments for larger weapons.
@stealth_armor_info=This armor has the ability to defract light around it, thus making the wearer virtually invisible. This effect doesn't work at high speeds, so the slower the wearer moves, the less visible they are to observers. This armor has only one pistol holster.
@trhev_antiaircraft_info=This Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) uses twin Bursters to throw 'flak' projectiles into the sky and is designed to destroy enemy aircraft. The rate of fire when Anchored makes these weapons especially formidable.
@trhev_antipersonnel_info=Using the Dual-Cyclers mounted on its arms, this anti-infantry configuration of the MAX (Mechanized Assault eXo-suit) can unleash great volumes of lead in any direction, especially when Anchored.
@trhev_antivehicular_info=The arm-mounted Pounders on this MAX are highly explosive indirect-fire weapons that can be unleashed at a high rate of fire, especially when the MAX is Anchored.
@nchev_antiaircraft_info=This MAX uses the Sparrow Missile Launcher to track and destroy enemy aircraft.
@nchev_antipersonnel_info=The heavy assault Scattercannon is typically used by this MAX to destroy enemy personnel and cause collateral damage.
@nchev_antivehicular_info=The dumbfire Falcon used by this Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) can punch through the heaviest of armor and is used widely to destroy enemy ground vehicles.
@vshev_antiaircraft_info=This MAX uses the Starfire weapon to home in and destroy enemy aircraft.
@vshev_antipersonnel_info=This nimble MAX uses the Quasar rifle to destroy enemy personnel and create collateral damage.
@vshev_antivehicular_info=The Comet anti-armor weaponry is used by this Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) to destroy enemy armor and ground targets.

# MISC EQUIPMENT
@ace_info=The ACE uses nano-tech to create matrix patterns in one of four varieties. Used by Combat Engineers exclusively, the ACE can be deployed as either a High-Explosive Mine, a remote-detonated Boomer, a deployable Spitfire turret, or a deployable Motion Sensor Alarm. 
@bank_info=The Body Armor Nano Kit, or BANK, is designed to repair damaged body armor. The BANK requires a Repair certification in order to utilize its functionality. The BANK uses an Armor Canister as fuel to repair Body Armor - when the Armor Canister is depleted, the soldier can load another Armor Canister (if carried).
@frag_grenade_info=Fragmentation grenades skewer their blast radius with shrapnel when exploding. Soldiers are particularly vulnerable to fragmentation grenades, as the shrapnel can easily pierce body armor. The closer the soldier is to the fragmentation grenade when it explodes, the higher the damage quotient (due to the increased chance of being hit by shrapnel). It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.
@jammer_grenade_info=Designed specifically to interfere with exposed electrical systems, the Jammer grenade doesn't impart any physical damage, but can play havoc with a myriad of electrical equipment. Any electrical equipment caught within a Jammer grenade's blast will be affected. The effects of the Jammer grenade are also proximity-based; the closer electrical equipment is to the epicenter, the longer the jamming effect. It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.\nJammers can disrupt the function of turrets and motion sensors, they reset the implant timers on all soldiers in the area, and they confuse radar images for those affected.
@medkit_info=The standard Med-Kit restores health points to a soldier. This can be done quickly, in the field, when injured and in an urgent situation.\n\nNOTE: To use a medkit, drag it to your hotbar and then activate it by hitting the appropriate F-key.
@medicalapplicator_info=The Applicator is a multi-purpose medical tool that can be administered to self or other friendly soldiers. The Applicator uses a standard Health canister for performing any function, and each respective function consumes varying amounts of reservoir points. When a Health canister is emptied, a soldier can load a new canister (if carried). 
@mine_sweeper_info=The Mine Sweeper is a small electrical device that emits a specialized magnetic field that will trigger and instantly destroy any enemy mines within its radius. The Mine Sweeper is actually treated like a grenade in usage - the player literally throws it into an area at which point it explodes, destroying any enemy mines within its radius.
@nano_dispenser_info=The NanoDispenser is a large repair device that is held similarly to a two-handed assault rifle. A soldier can repair any damaged object or vehicle using the NanoDispenser, and uses reservoir points for fuel when repairing. The NanoDispenser requires a Repair certification in order to utilize its functionality. It uses a replaceable Armor Canister for fuel.
@plasma_grenade_info=The Plasma grenade contains highly-compressed plasma which sprays an area and any unfortunate nearby soldiers, objects, or vehicles with burning plasma when exploding. Any soldiers, objects, or vehicles hit by the scathing plasma will continue to receive aggravated damage until the plasma's heat naturally subsides (or the recipient perishes). It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.
@remote_electronics_kit_info=The Remote Electronics Kit (REK) is a hand-held hacking device that can remotely interface with the majority of enemy terminal types at close range. Most REK functions require either Hacking or Advanced Hacking Certification, but there are also standard functions that don't require any hacking certifications.
@command_detonater_info=This uplink device is only available to Rank 1 Commanders and above.\n\nThis mechanism is used to communicate with automatic systems high above Auraxis in the Orbital Station.\n\nMost timed command abilities require the equipping of this item before they will function.

@two_man_assault_buggy=Harasser
@two_man_assault_buggyd=Destroyed Harasser
@two_man_assault_buggys=Harassers
@two_man_assault_buggyinfo=The Harasser has room for a driver and a gunner. Both people sit in an open-air compartment that affords little protection, but lightens the vehicle to increase its speed. The passenger position has a mounted 12mm Rotary Chaingun that can be used to "ride shotgun" in an anti-infantry role. 
@two_man_assault_buggy_destroyed=Your Harasser has been destroyed.

@twomanhoverbuggy=Thresher
@twomanhoverbuggyd=Destroyed Thresher
@twomanhoverbuggys=Threshers
@twomanhoverbuggyinfo=The Vanu Sovereignty's version of a Heavy Buggy is built upon a gravitic drive system that replaces the usual wheels with 4 anti grav pods that propel the buggy. It sports a horizontally-limited Flux Cannon that serves as the primary weapon. Though the Vanu Sovereignty's version of an Assault Buggy may not be as armored or feature the wide firing arcs that other Empires have, its hover capabilities allow it to effectively strafe left or right thus offsetting some of its other disadvantages with increased maneuverability. In addition, this hover capability allows the Vanu Sovereignty hover buggy to sustain travel over water for short periods of time, allowing it to easily ford small rivers and ponds.
@twomanhoverbuggy_destroyed=Your Thresher has been destroyed.

@twomanheavybuggy=Enforcer
@twomanheavybuggyd=Destroyed Enforcer
@twomanheavybuggys=Enforcers
@twomanheavybuggyinfo=The New Conglomerate's version of a heavy buggy sports an Advanced Rocket Launcher mounted in an open 360 degree turret located above and behind the driver.\n\nThe ARL (aka Firebird) is a single barreled rocket launcher that automatically reloads after firing providing extra rockets are available in the 'trunk space' of the vehicle.
@twomanheavybuggy_destroyed=Your Enforcer has been destroyed.

@threemanheavybuggy=Marauder
@threemanheavybuggyd=Destroyed Marauder
@threemanheavybuggys=Marauders
@threemanheavybuggyinfo=The Marauder heavy buggy sports more armor, fire power, and passengers than the buggies of other Empires. The primary weapon system consists of a 360-degree capable heavy proximity grenade launcher (Ground Pounder) mounted in the rear.  The Grenade Launcher is a relatively short barreled weapon that can fire off several rounds before needing to reload. The secondary weapon system is a 12 mm Rotary Chaingun mounted to the right of the driver. 
@threemanheavybuggy_destroyed=Your Marauder has been destroyed.

@quadassault=Basilisk
@quadassaultd=Destroyed Basilisk
@quadassaults=Basilisks
@quadassaultinfo=The four-wheeled ATV Assault Quad is the most agile attack vehicle, combining reasonably potent offensive capabilities and speed. The primary weakness of the Assault Quad is its light armor that allows the vehicle its superior handling.\n\nThe General Assault Quad has Light Rotary Chainguns mounted side-by-side in front of the rider.
@quadassault_destroyed=Your Basilisk has been destroyed.

@quadstealth=Wraith
@quadstealthd=Destroyed Wraith
@quadstealths=Stealth Wraiths
@quadstealthinfo=The fastest and most agile of all land-based vehicles, the Wraith trades armor and all offensive capabilities for sheer speed, maneuverability, and stealth. Designed specifically as a reconnaissance vehicle, the Wraith has a unique light refraction system that effectively cloaks it visually at long range only if the rider is wearing a Stealth Suit. The integrated stealth system complements the light fraction, removing the Wraith from most radar systems. In addition a white noise generator helps to dampen the Wraith's engine noise.
@quadstealth_destroyed=Your Wraith has been destroyed.

@vanguard=Vanguard
@vanguardd=Destroyed Vanguard
@vanguards=Vanguards
@vanguardinfo=The Vanguard is the main battle tank for the New Conglomerate. Generally well balanced, the Vanguard brings decent speed, solid armor, and hefty firepower to the field. The main turret pivots 360 degrees and houses a 150mm Tank Cannon. The gunner can also switch to a limited pivot 20mm Recoilless Cannon for infantry supression.
@vanguard_destroyed=Your Vanguard has been destroyed.

@lightning=Lightning
@lightningd=Destroyed Lightning
@lightnings=Lightnings
@lightninginfo=The Lightning is a single seated mini tank which is fairly fast but lacking much in the way of armor, making it best suited to running escort or in packs. The Lightning is outfitted with a 75mm Tank Cannon as it's primary weapon. Next to the Cannon is a secondary Light Rotary Chaingun used as an anti-infantry weapon.
@lightning_destroyed=Your Lightning has been destroyed.

@prowler=Prowler
@prowlerd=Destroyed Prowler
@prowlers=Prowlers
@prowlerinfo=The Prowler is the largest Main Battle Tank. Having the most armor for a Tank and a 360-degree capable dual 100mm heavy tank turret, the Prowler is certainly able to devastate many targets in short order. The secondary gunner is able to control a dual Rotary Chaingun which is a small turret stacked upon the primary turret. Naturally the sheer size, weight, and firepower of this tank makes it slower than any of the Main Battle tanks.
@prowler_destroyed=Your Prowler has been destroyed.

@magrider=Magrider
@magriderd=Destroyed Magrider
@magriders=Magriders
@magriderinfo=The Magrider is the Vanu Sovereignty's Main Battle Tank.\n\nBuilt upon Vanu Alien technology, it has the ability to hover across both ground and water.\n\nThis propulsion system also gives the Magrider the ability to strafe left or right. The drawback, however, is that the Sovereignty has not perfected the anti-gravitic drive yet so weight is still a critical issue.\n\nBecause of this, their primary weapon, a heavy energy rail beam has a limited forward pivot.\n\nThe secondary weapon system, which the pilot controls, is a light Pulsed Particle Accelerator, and is mounted on the front of the vehicle.  
@magrider_destroyed=Your Magrider has been destroyed.

@mosquito=Mosquito
@mosquitod=Destroyed Mosquito
@mosquitos=Mosquitoes
@mosquitoinfo=The Mosquito is fast, agile, and lightly armored. It carries only a Light Rotary Chaingun (12mm), but it can easily slip past most sensory defenses (it's not visible on radar) and is primarly a scout craft. The Mosquito only carries a single pilot.
@mosquito_destroyed=Your Mosquito has been destroyed.

@lightgunship=Reaver
@lightgunshipd=Destroyed Reaver
@lightgunships=Reavers
@lightgunshipinfo=The Reaver carries much more armor and ordnance than the lighter Mosquito. Of course, this makes it less maneuverable, but the Reaver is easily the king of the skies with it's forward-firing 20mm Recoilless Cannon and secondary firing Rocket Launchers. The Reaver, like the Mosquito, carries only a single pilot.
@lightgunship_destroyed=Your Reaver has been destroyed.

@dropship=Galaxy
@dropshipd=Destroyed Galaxy
@dropships=Galaxies
@dropshipinfo=The Galaxy is a gigantic aircraft capable of carrying a pilot, three gunners, two MAXs, six other passengers, as well as a vehicle in the back (with passengers). Fully loaded, with passengers in the vehicle stowed in back, the Galaxy can easily carry a full Squad of soldiers, plus a pilot and gun crew to bring them to the battle intact and alive. The gunner positions have 20mm Chainguns to use in defense against airborne targets, or they can be alternately used to pound ground targets from above.
@dropship_destroyed=Your Galaxy has been destroyed.

@amsd=Destroyed Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)
@amss=Advanced Mobile Stations (AMSs)
@amsinfo=The Advanced Mobile Station is the lynchpin in many attack strategies. Once driven to a location and deployed, the AMS allows soldiers to store their patterns at its respawning tubes for quick redeployment after death. It also carries a full Equipment Terminal allowing soldiers to reequip in the field. When deployed, the AMS automatically cloaks beyond a short distance in order to better shield it from enemy troops.
@ams_destroyed=Your Advanced Mobile Station has been destroyed.
@ams_decaystarted=The AMS you are bound to has lost its' owner.  It will auto-deconstruct in 15 minutes.
@ams_decayed=The AMS you are bound to has been auto-deconstructed due to lack of owner.
@ams_deconstructed=The AMS you are bound to has been deconstructed by its owner.

@ant=Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)
@antd=Destroyed Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)
@ants=Advanced Nanite Transports (ANTs)
@antinfo=The Advanced Nanite Transport is the backbone of the system to draw energy from the ancient Vanu warp bubbles.\n\nUsable by all members of all Empires, the ANT is driven to warp gate bubbles where it deploys its charging vanes.\n\nOnce the capacitors onboard are filled, the ANT is driven to a battle facility and deployed near a Silo. The energy then coruscates over to the Silo collector and the facility gains enough energy to be fully powered for a time.
@ant_destroyed=Your ANT has been destroyed.

@apc=Sunder
@apcd=Destroyed Sunder
@apcs=Sunders
@apcinfo=The Sunder is a large, lumbering heavy ground transport capable of carrying a driver, two gunners, six passengers, and two MAXs. The gunners man two large 75mm Tank Cannons to be used in defense against vehicles, but depend on squad members disembarking to protect against infantry attack.
@apc_destroyed=Your Sunder has been destroyed.

@mediumtransport=Deliverer
@mediumtransportd=Destroyed Deliverer
@mediumtransports=Deliverers
@mediumtransportinfo=The Deliverer is a medium transport capable of carrying up to five occupants (1 driver, 2 gunners, 2 passengers). While less maneuverable than assault buggies, the Deliverer has two gunners -- one next to the driver, facing forward, the other in the rear, covering the back. A reasonable trunk provides adequate space to carry supplies as well.\n\nThe Deliverer also has the distinct advantage of being able to cross calm rivers and waterways. When entering water, the Deliverer will float at the surface, but is only capable of 30% of its maximum speed when crossing water.
@mediumtransport_destroyed=Your Deliverer has been destroyed.

@droppod=Drop Pod
@droppodd=Destroyed Drop Pod
@droppods=Drop Pods
@droppodinfo=The Drop Pod allows reentry through the atmosphere down to the planet below.
@droppod_destroyed=Your Drop Pod has been destroyed.

# Implant Description Strings
#---------------------------------------------------------
@ImplantTerminalTitle=Implant Terminal
@Advanced_Regen_Descrip=Health Regeneration allows you to use Stamina points to quickly regenerate missing Health points at the cost of two Stamina points for each Health point regained.
@Targeting_Descrip=Advanced Targeting allows you to see the name and health of enemy characters under your reticule. It also reveals the names of enemies within a vehicle, as well as revealing enemy deployables at a greater range.
@Audio_Amplifier_Descrip=This implant amplifies footsteps of nearby soldiers, allowing onboard systems to analyze that sound and place enemy soldier locations on your personal radar, thus revealing their position when they are running.
@Darklight_Vision_Descrip=The Darklight implant greatly reduces your normal visibility while simultaneously shifting your perceptions to allow you to see cloaked enemies in an area around you.
@Melee_Booster_Descrip=This implant drains a soldier's Stamina when he swings a knife, but greatly enhances the damage of that knife when it hits.
@Personal_Shield_Descrip=This implant harnesses a soldier's Stamina and turns it into a personal force field that blocks incoming damage on a one for one basis.
@Range_Magnifier_Descrip=This implant is used instead of a weapon's normal zoom function, but has much greater capacity. Zoom levels are 4x, 8x, and 12x.
@Second_Wind_Descrip=When a soldier is on the brink of death, the Second Wind implant automatically strips Stamina away to boost Health to safer levels. After each use, a recharge period must elapse before Second Wind can be used again.
@Silent_Run_Descrip=Using counter-frequency technology, the Silent Run implant completely nullifies the sounds of the soldier's footsteps. The bulkier the armor being worn, the more Stamina is used to muffle the footstep sounds.
@Surge_Descrip=This implant boosts the footspeed of a soldier by draining his Stamina to power enhanced leg units. The bulkier the armor being worn, the more Stamina is required to achieve the Surge in speed.

# Certification descriptions
#---------------------------------------------------------
@CertDescription_standard_assault=Allows a soldier to utilize the AMP and Suppressor. Empire-specific weaponry available through this certification includes the Beamer (VS), Repeater (TR), and Scatter-Pistol (NC)
@CertDescription_medium_assault=The Sweeper and Punisher are available through this certification. Empire-specific weaponry available includes the Pulsar (VS), Cycler (TR), and Gauss Rifle (NC)
@CertDescription_heavy_assault=Heavy assault weapons for each empire are the Lasher (VS), Mini-Chaingun (TR), and Jackhammer (NC)
@CertDescription_special_assault=These weapons include the Decimator, Rocklet Gun, and Thumper (all common pool)
@CertDescription_anti_vehicular=Empire-specific weaponry includes the Lancer (VS), Striker (TR), and Phoenix (NC)
@CertDescription_sniper=This certification allows a soldier to use the Bolt Driver sniper rifle.
@CertDescription_advanced_nanite_transport=The Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT) is the vehicle used to collect energy at warp gates and transport it to a Silo for use as an energy source for the facility.\n\nThe ANT itself is a machine designed to generate billions of nanites (of a pattern extrapolated from old Vanu records). Those nanites are able to extract energy from the dimensional flux inside a warp bubble and act like tiny batteries.\n\nWhen an ANT deploys near a Silo, the carrier beam from the ANT forces the nanites to move to the Silo.\n\nThe Silo closely, but not exactly, emulates the environment found in the warp bubbles. (Silos are human tech and Humanity isn't close to understading all the inter-dimensional physics techniques.) Because the Silo is imperfect, the nanites can't generate new power from the faux-warp environment and eventually die out, requiring them to be resupplied.\n\nIn the act of dissolution, the nanite's expiration releases the stored energy within them to the collectors within the Silo. The Silo harnesses that energy for use by the facilities and the ANT makes another round trip to keep the facility supplied.
@CertDescription_quad_stealth=The Wraith is a four-wheeled cycle with stealth capabilities *IF* you are wearing an Infiltration Suit. Otherwise, it acts as a normal four-wheeled cycle.

@CertDescription_mechanized_assault_suit=This heaviest of armor entombs a soldier beneath layers and layers of hardened armor and its weapons are built into the arms of the suit, making them very stable firing platforms. Slow in reaction speed, but powerful in almost every other way, the mech assault suits are lynchpins of most military actions.

# Static Object Messages
@xp_adv_med_terminal_label=Advanced Medical Station
@xp_adv_med_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Advanced Medical Station. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this station.
@xp_adv_med_terminal_message=ADVANCED MEDICAL STATION\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis advanced medical station scans your matrix, looking for abnormalities. Nanites are then activated within your body while you're in the scanning field, and any defects to both health AND armor are repaired.\n\nOnce you step into the Advanced Medical Station, you will automatically begin healing/repairing.\n\nYou can step out of the station at any time to interrupt this process.\n\nIf your Empire owns a Bio Lab elsewhere on the continent, then this terminal will act as an Advanced Medical Terminal and will repair armor as well as heal body damage.
@xp_air_vehicle_terminal_label=Air Vehicle Terminal
@xp_air_vehicle_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Air Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_air_vehicle_message=AIR VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nFast-attack aircraft are found here.\n\nTo acquire an air vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad located directly outside. You must claim it (by sitting in the pilot position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_air_vehicle_terminal_message=AIR VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nFast-attack aircraft are found here.\n\nTo acquire an air vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad located directly outside. You must claim it (by sitting in the pilot position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_capture_terminal_label=Control Terminal
@xp_capture_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Control Terminal.
@xp_capture_terminal_message=CONTROL TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe nerve center of each facility, the Control Terminal interfaces with the Human tech terminals in the building and is also the mechanism used to converse with the Vanu tech at the core of the planet.\n\nBy introducing viral code via a hand-held REK unit, this core can be made to conform to other Empire parameter sets.\n\nThus, the Control Terminal is both a strength (interface between human and Vanu tech) as well as a weakness (other Empires can exploit its singular control to take over the base).\n\nBecause of this, it is typically guarded quite securely by intelligent defenders.
@xp_certification_terminal_label=Certification Terminal
@xp_certification_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Certification Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_certification_terminal_message=CERTIFICATION TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis terminal interfaces with your Empire's military records and programs the smart-chip embedded in your body to allow access to various vehicles, weapons, and equipment.\n\nWithout such programming, you will not be granted access to utilize that equipment.\n\nUse this terminal to spend Certification Points awarded by your Empire to unlock access to weapons, vehicles, equipment, and armors.
@xp_deconstruction_label=Respawn Tube
@xp_deconstruction_descrip=You are facing a Respawn Tube. You are awarded 50 BEP for visiting this tube.
@xp_deconstruction_message=RESPAWN TUBE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nAfter death, you will respawn in a tube like this one.\n\nYou may also voluntarily deconstruct yourself within this tube so that you can reappear in other allowed respawn locations.
@xp_external_door_lock_label=Security Lock
@xp_external_door_lock_descrip=You are facing a Security Lock. You are awarded 100 BEP for investigating this lock.
@xp_external_door_lock_message=SECURITY LOCK\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nEach door to the outside world is equipped with anti-viral encoding to prevent hackers from penetrating this passive defense.\n\nOf course, it's only a matter of time for a dedicated hacker to work through those code defenses.\n\nEven average soldiers can use a REK to pass through a secured door, if they have enough uninterrupted time.
@xp_galaxy_terminal_label=Air Transport Terminal
@xp_galaxy_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Air Transport Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_galaxy_terminal_message=AIR TRANSPORT TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis facility has the power and space to create the giant Galaxy dropships, as well as the smaller Mosquitoes and Reavers as well.\n\nTo acquire one of these air vehicles, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad located directly outside. You must claim it (by sitting in the pilot position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_generator_label=Facility Generator
@xp_generator_descrip=You are facing this facility's generator. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting the generator.
@xp_generator_message=FACILITY GENERATOR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis large generator takes the energy stored in the Silo's nannites and converts it into a form useable by Human technology.\n\nIf destroyed, all elements needing power in this facility (except the Control Terminal which runs on an independent power source) will be disabled until the generator is repaired.\n\nWhen disabled, the generator will self-repair over time using existing nanites and the scant power released by passive systems within the generator.\n\nThis automated repair process can be boosted by manually repairing the generator with a Nano-Dispenser.
@xp_ground_vehicle_terminal_label=Ground Vehicle Terminal
@xp_ground_vehicle_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Ground Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_ground_vehicle_terminal_message=GROUND VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nGround vehicles are available at this terminal.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to investigate the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button on your Soldier Management Menu. (NOTE: That menu is raised by clicking the 'Soldier Management Menu' button on the right side of your 'Status' pane...the one with healthbars and holsters.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_implant_terminal_label=Implant Terminal
@xp_implant_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Implant Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_implant_terminal_message=IMPLANT TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nUpon stepping into the Implant Terminal, you are dematrixed, reconfigured and formed into a new whole with additional (and authorized) capabilities, a better soldier for your Empire.\n\nChoose among the various Implants available, and click on the 'Install Implant' button at the bottom of the screen in order to gain use of that implant and exit the terminal.\n\nImplants are easily removed by using the 'Remove Implant' button.\n\nYou will gain one Implant slot for every six Battle Ranks you achieve.\n\nEach Implant has an 'activation time' that must pass before the implant can be used. This activation time occurs after initially installing the implant, but also occurs when being re-matrixed at a respawning tube.
@xp_locker_label=Equipment Locker
@xp_locker_descrip=You are facing an Equipment Locker. You are awarded 100 BEP for investigating this locker.
@xp_locker_message=EQUIPMENT LOCKER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nWhen your generator has been destroyed, you have no access to equipment terminals.\n\nAt times like that, a few items securely stored away in your Locker can be of great assistance.\n\nYour locker is virtual and is stored in your Empire's database. When you access the door to your locker, all items are reconstructed from pattern, thus allowing your Locker to be accessed anywhere within your Empire's holdings.\n\nNeedless to say, because of that, you cannot access your Locker in an enemy-held building.
@xp_med_terminal_label=Medical Station
@xp_med_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Medical Station. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this station.
@xp_med_terminal_message=MEDICAL STATION\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis medical station scans your matrix, looking for abnormalities. Nanites are then activated within your body while you're in the scanning field, and any Health defects are repaired.\n\nOnce you step into the Medical Station, you will automatically begin healing.\n\nYou can step out of the station at any time to interrupt this process.
@xp_order_terminal_label=Equipment Terminal
@xp_order_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Equipment Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_order_terminal_message=EQUIPMENT TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis terminal allows access to Weapons, Armor, Equipment, Ammunition, and Favorites.\n\nAfter pressing the 'Use Key' to open the equipment interface, double-click on any item to automatically put it in your inventory.\n\nTo delete items from your inventory, select them and move them to the 'Destroy' button. To remove ALL items from your inventory, use the 'Clear Inventory' button.\n\nTo save your current inventory configuration, click the "Favorites" button (on the far right) and double-click on an empty Favorite. This allows you to save your current config with a unique name so it can be retrieved quickly later.
@xp_respawn_terminal_label=Matrix Storage Panel
@xp_respawn_terminal_descrip=You are facing the Matrix Storage Panel. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this panel.
@xp_respawn_terminal_message=MATRIX STORAGE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nRecord your personal matrix here at this panel and you can respawn at this location, regardless of whether it is a 'nearest' facility or AMS.\n\nThis allows you different tactical options. For instance, you might manually bind at a Tech Plant across the continent and then decide to defend a friendly facility elsewhere on the continent so that you could respawn either at that defended facility (nearest bind) or at the tech plant (manual bind).
@xp_secondary_capture=Control Point
@xp_secondary_capture_label=Gun Tower Control Point
@xp_secondary_capture_descrip=You are facing the Gun Tower Control Point. You are awarded 50 BEP for visiting this point.
@xp_secondary_capture_message=GUN TOWER CONTROL POINT\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis is the capture point for the Gun Tower.\n\nIn order to capture this facility for your Empire, equip a REK and hack this control point.\n\nThere is no capture period that occurs after hacking a control point. Once the hack is complete, the Gun Tower will switch ownership to your Empire immediately and all equipment herein can be used by your Empire.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_amp_label=Amp Station Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_amp_descrip=You are facing the Amp Station Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_amp_message=AMP LAB VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe AMS, Sunderer, and Deliverer tactical vehicles can be created here.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_bio_label=Bio Lab Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_bio_descrip=You are facing the Bio Station Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_bio_message=BIO STATION VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Basilisk, Wraith, Harasser, and your Empire's heavy buggy can be created here.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_dc_label=Dropship Center Station Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_dc_descrip=You are facing the Dropship Center Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_dc_message=DROPSHIP CENTER VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Lightning, Harasser, and your Empire's heavy buggy can be created here. Each of these vehicles can be loaded into the back of a Galaxy Troop Transport.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_int_label=Interlink Facility Vehicle Terminal
@xp_vehicle_terminal_int_descrip=You are facing the Interlink Facility Vehicle Terminal. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this terminal.
@xp_vehicle_terminal_int_message=INTERLINK FACILITY VEHICLE TERMINAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Lightning and your Empire's heavy tank can be created here.\n\nTo acquire a ground vehicle, either double-click the vehicle's name, or single-click it and then click the "Acquire Vehicle" button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nAfter acquiring a vehicle, be sure to check out the vehicle permissions dialog by clicking the 'Vehicle' button at the far right of your Soldier Management Menu.\n\nOnce your vehicle has been created, it will sit on the Vehicle Pad below. You must claim it (by sitting in the driver position) within one minute, or the vehicle will be automatically deconstructed to make room for other vehicle creations.
@xp_wall_turret_label=Defensive Wall Turret
@xp_wall_turret_descrip=You are facing a Defensive Wall Turret. You are awarded 100 BEP for investigating this turret.
@xp_wall_turret_message=DEFENSIVE WALL TURRET\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThese turrets can be either manned by soldiers, or left empty as an automated defense.\n\nTo man a turret, simply get into it. The controls are self-explanatory.\n\nTurrets are only automated if your Empire currently owns an Interlink Facility somewhere on this continent.\n\nIf no Interlink Facility is owned, then the turrets will NOT automatically fire on any targets.\n\nEven when an Interlink Facility is owned, turrets will only target enemy vehicles, unless Deployable Motion Sensors are placed to assist in detecting the smaller, humanoid movements.
@xp_warpgate_label=Warpgate
@xp_warpgate_descrip=You are inside a Warp Bubble. You are awarded 100 BEP for entering the warp gate area.
@xp_warpgate_message=WARP GATE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nYou are within the perimeter of a warp bubble.\n\nTo warp to another continent, move directly into the central column of light on top of the warp pad itself.\n\nIf you're on a Sanctuary, you are using a 'broadcast' warpgate that allows you to move to any other warpgate in the world.\n\nThe exception to 'any' warpgate is that you can't broadcast to locked continents or to enemy Sanctuaries.\n\nWhile you, or anyone else, is in the warp bubble, their matrix is shifted slightly between dimensions to avoid contact with other objects during phasing. Passing through other objects or vehicles will not harm you.\n\nYour weapons will not fire while dimensionally phased. They will return to normal when you exit the warp bubble.

# Weapon Help Messages
@xp_beamer_label=Beamer
@xp_beamer_descrip=You have equipped the Beamer energy pistol. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_beamer_message=BEAMER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Beamer's main advantage lies in that it only uses a single ammunition source (the energy cell) and powers both its standard and armor piercing attacks from that same source, thus minimizing inventory space needed.\n\nThe armor-piercing shots use twice as much energy as the standard shots.\n\nBecause this is a pistol, the recoil on it is fairly severe. Thus for best accuracy, single shots or short bursts will result in the best accuracy.
@xp_bolt_driver_label=Bolt Driver
@xp_bolt_driver_descrip=You have equipped the Bolt Driver sniper rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_bolt_driver_message=BOLT DRIVER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Bolt Driver uses a high-caliber "bolt" as its ammunition source and is a very powerful weapon.\n\nIts main drawback is that the reload time is quite slow, making it less useful in close quarters. But when used in the field, in tandem with its 8X zoom, the rifle can be quite deadly.
@xp_chainblade_label=Chainblade
@xp_chainblade_descrip=You have equipped the Chainblade, the fall-back weapon of the Terran Republic. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_chainblade_message=CHAINBLADE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe primary attack of the chainblade is as a standard knife. The main advantage to this is that the attack is very quiet and can be used to stealthily dispose of wounded foes.\n\nThe secondary mode activates the chainblade around the edge of the knife. This attack is much more powerful, but is quite loud.
@xp_cycler_label=Cycler
@xp_cycler_descrip=You have equipped the Cycler assault rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_cycler_message=CYCLER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis rapid-firing rifle has an extended range over the Suppressor and a 4X zoom to help target with that extended range.\n\nEven with its increased rate of fire, the magazine's clip of 50 bullets is good for an extended exchange of fire.
@xp_flechette_label=Sweeper Shotgun
@xp_flechette_descrip=You have equipped the Sweeper shotgun. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_flechette_message=SWEEPER SHOTGUN\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe power of the multiple slugs that are used in this weapon's burst allow surprising penetrating power.\n\nUseful against suits and lightly armored vehicles, the Sweeper shotgun is a backbone weapon for many ground assault forces across Auraxis.
@xp_forceblade_label=Forceblade
@xp_forceblade_descrip=You have equipped the Forceblade, the fall-back weapon of the Vanu Sovereignty. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_forceblade_message=FORCEBLADE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe primary attack of the forceblade is as a standard knife. The main advantage to this is that the attack is very quiet and can be used to stealthily dispose of wounded foes.\n\nThe secondary mode activates an energy field over the blade of the knife. This attack is much more powerful, but is quite bright and easily seen.
@xp_gauss_label=Gauss Rifle
@xp_gauss_descrip=You have equipped the Gauss Rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_gauss_message=GAUSS RIFLE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe magnetically accelerated round from this rifle has very high velocity and thus has very high penetrating power.
@xp_grenade_frag_label=Fragmentation Grenade
@xp_grenade_frag_descrip=You have equipped the Fragmentation Grenade. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_frag_message=FRAGMENTATION GRENADE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Fragmentation (frag) grenade explodes, causing shrapnel damage to all within its area of effect.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy. (The VR Shooting Range is excellent for this type of practice.)
@xp_grenade_jammer_label=Jammer Grenade
@xp_grenade_jammer_descrip=You have equipped the Jammer Grenade. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_jammer_message=JAMMER GRENADE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Jammer Grenade is used to deactivate lightly shielded electrical devices.\n\nThe Jammer will deactivate (temporarily) all Spitfire turrets and Motion Sensors in the area, as well as deactivating all implants on enemy soldiers within the area.\n\nAny implants thus deactivated have to 'reactivate' by letting their activation timer expire again, so this can be quite useful.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy. (The VR Shooting Range is excellent for this type of practice.)
@xp_grenade_plasma_label=Plasma Grenade
@xp_grenade_plasma_descrip=You have equipped the Plasma Grenade. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_plasma_message=PLASMA GRENADE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nSeething hot plasma covers your target and continues to burn for a short time after detonation. This causes continuous damage over time and tends to make enemies very unhappy.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy. (The VR Shooting Range is excellent for this type of practice.)
@xp_grenade_minesweeper_label=Minesweeper
@xp_grenade_minesweeper_descrip=You have equipped the Minesweeper. You are awarded 25 BEP for using this weapon for the first time.
@xp_grenade_minesweeper_message=MINESWEEPER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Minesweeper detonates all mines in the proximity of its own explosion. This allows you to clear a minefield with little danger.\n\nOf course, all those mines exploding is bound to attract enemies to see what happened to their mines, so watch out.\n\nLike all grenades, this one has either a three-second fuse delay (for bouncing around corners) or an 'explode on contact' setting that lets you directly hit a target and have the detonation occur immediately.\n\nThe range of the grenade is dependent upon how long you hold it after clicking the left mouse button.\n\nThe longer you hold the button, the farther you will throw the grenade.\n\nExperiment with it for greatest accuracy.
@xp_hunterseeker_label=Phoenix Missile Launcher
@xp_hunterseeker_descrip=You have equipped the Phoenix missile launcher. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_hunterseeker_message=PHOENIX\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis weapon is camera-guided. As soon as the missile is fired, your perspective will change to the view of the actual missile projectile and you will 'fly' your missile toward its target.\n\nThis takes some practice to refine, but if the operator of the weapon is skilled, this missile launcher is particularly accurate and devastating.\n\nThe missile's warhead may be detonated at any time by hitting the 'fire' key, thus allowing an operator to salvage a near-miss if detonated close enough to the target to cause damage anyway.
@xp_ilc9_label=AMP
@xp_ilc9_descrip=You have equipped the Automatic Machine Pistol (AMP). You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_ilc9_message=AUTOMATIC MACHINE PISTOL (AMP)\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nBeware this weapon's rate of fire. Although superb for "suppressive" fire (inundating an area with projectiles), it is quite inaccurate beyond very short ranges unless fired in single shots or small bursts.
@xp_isp_label=MAG-Scatter Pistol
@xp_isp_descrip=You have equipped the MAG Scatter Pistol. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_isp_message=MAG-SCATTER PISTOL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis powerful magnetically-accelerated, hand-held pistol is, in reality, very similar to a shotgun with an extremely short barrel.\n\nIts projectiles spread out rapidly, but there are a great number of them. At close range, they do amazing damage, but as the shots spread out, they become more unlikely to hit what you were aiming at, and thus the weapon is less effective beyond a short range.
@xp_lancer_label=Lancer
@xp_lancer_descrip=You have equipped the Lancer beam rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_lancer_message=LANCER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis heavy beam rifle is particularly useful against vehicular targets (including MAXs). Although still potent against softer targets, the Lancer punches through armor spectacularly well.\n\nNote that after pulling the trigger, there is a half-second delay while the Lancer's internal capacitor charges then automatically releases the energy bolt.\n\nIf fired at a moving target, the Lancer must continue to be aimed at the target until the energy bolt fully charges and releases.
@xp_lasher_label=Lasher
@xp_lasher_descrip=You have equipped the Lasher heavy energy rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_lasher_message=LASHER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Lasher's energy projectile is extremely slow, however, if it impacts a target, it does impressive damage.\n\nThe Lasher 'orb' also seeks nearby targets and lashes out energy tendrils toward that target, so that even a near-miss can still do damage.\n\nThis results in a particularly lethal weapon when used against squads in close formation. However, when firing the Lasher extra care must be employed as the ‘orb' cannot differentiate from friend or foe, and will lash out at any nearby target.
@xp_magcutter_label=MAG-cutter
@xp_magcutter_descrip=You have equipped the MAG-cutter, the fall-back weapon of the New Conglomerate. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_magcutter_message=MAG-CUTTER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe primary attack of the MAG-Cutter is as a standard knife. The main advantage to this is that the attack is very quiet and can be used to stealthily dispose of wounded foes.\n\nThe secondary mode activates a magnetic vibrating field around the blade. This attack is much more powerful, but the hum is quite distinctive and easily heard in the area it is used.
@xp_mini_chaingun_label=Mini-Chaingun
@xp_mini_chaingun_descrip=You have equipped the Mini-Chaingun. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_mini_chaingun_message=MINI-CHAINGUN\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis weapon has a simple function. Unleash as many projectiles as possible, in as narrow a cone as possible, in the smallest amount of time possible.\n\nIt does this quite well.\n\nWith a reasonable range, and low recoil, the mini-chaingun can destroy infantry targets, or if AP ammo is used, is even effective against vehicles.\n\nThe mini-chaingun's sole drawback is that it chews through ammunition so quickly that it can be hard to keep it supplied when in anything except a Reinforced Exo-Suit.
@xp_phoenix_label=Decimator
@xp_phoenix_descrip=You have equipped the Decimator disposable missile launcher. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_phoenix_message=DECIMATOR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe warhead of this disposable missile launcher is extremely powerful, but the weapon is limited to only three shots before its built-in clip is depleted and the weapon must be discarded.\n\nOnce all shots are fired, the weapon is automatically dropped to clear your inventory for other items.\n\nThe projectile is dumb-fire, so you should lead your target carefully for best results.\n\nIf you want to get a closer view of your target, you can also fire this weapon in a secondary firing mode that allows a dumb-fire projectile with you attached in camera view. Use this tactically to spy out a remote position.
@xp_pulsar_label=Pulsar
@xp_pulsar_descrip=You have equipped the Pulsar heavy beam rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_pulsar_message=PULSAR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Pulsar is essentially a rifle version of the Beamer pistol.  The Pulsar uses energy cells for fuel, and can switch between standard and armor-piercing effect by toggling between primary and secondary fire modes.\n\nThe weapon has a long firing range, 4X zoom, and is easy on the inventory. Many Vanu soldiers find it a reliable and useful weapon.
@xp_punisher_label=Punisher
@xp_punisher_descrip=You have equipped the Punisher assault rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_punisher_message=PUNISHER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Swiss Army Knife of weaponry, the Punisher has two firing mechanisms.\n\nThe upper barrel is a rifle capable of switching between standard and armor-piercing ammunition.\n\nThe lower barrel is capable of firing either rocklet ammunition or lobbing grenades of three types: fragmentation, jammer, or plasma.\n\nThus, troops unsure of the type of engagement they are approaching often take the Punisher as a weapon.\n\nIts single drawback is that the rocklet/grenade barrel only has a magazine of one shot, so it's not as effective with those ammo types as more specialized weaponry.  However, the range on the Punisher, and its ability to 'panic fire' in tight situations, makes it a very popular weapon.
@xp_r_shotgun_label=Jackhammer
@xp_r_shotgun_descrip=You have equipped the Jackhammer rotary shotgun. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_r_shotgun_message=JACKHAMMER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Jackhammer is a heavy assault shotgun with a unique secondary fire mode.\n\nWhen firing in secondary mode, all three barrels are fired in rapid succession, faster than would occur if you pulled the trigger normally.  This results in incredible carnage in a short period of time.
@xp_repeater_label=Repeater
@xp_repeater_descrip=You have equipped the Repeater assault pistol. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_repeater_message=REPEATER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe standard sidearm of the Terran Republic, the Repeater has a large-caliber round, fired from an accurate barrel (for a pistol).\n\nThis results in good accuracy and hard hitting power, packaged into a smaller form than a rifle would take.
@xp_rocklet_label=Rocklet Rifle
@xp_rocklet_descrip=You have equipped the Rocklet projectile rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_rocklet_message=ROCKLET RIFLE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Rocklet Rifle is a special assault weapon with a unique secondary fire mode.\n\nWhen firing in secondary mode, all shots remaining in the magazine are fired in rapid succession, faster than would occur if you pulled the trigger normally.  This results in incredible carnage in a short period of time.  However, its disadvantage is that the weapon must be fully reloaded before it is capable of firing again.
@xp_striker_label=Striker Missile Launcher
@xp_striker_descrip=You have equipped the Striker missile launcher. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_striker_message=STRIKER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Striker is an anti-vehicular weapon.\n\nWhen the reticule is laid over an enemy vehicle, MAX, or turret, the Striker will attempt to lock onto that target.\n\nWhen lock is achieved, an audible tone will be heard, and the missile warhead will be guided to the target when fired.\n\nTo maintain lock on a target, the operator must hold the reticule over the target, even AFTER the warhead was fired. Failure to keep the reticule over the target will result in the warhead losing lock and becoming a dumb-fire, straight-line missile.\n\nThe Striker can intentionally be fired in dumb-fire mode by switching to its secondary firing mode.
@xp_suppressor_label=Suppressor Rifle
@xp_suppressor_descrip=You have equipped the Suppressor rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_suppressor_message=SUPPRESSOR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Suppressor does reasonable damage and has a very minor recoil effect, thus resulting in extremely accurate fully-automatic fire.\n\nThe only potential drawback to this weapon is its light hitting power, but its rate of fire and tight accuracy often compensates for any disadvantages.
@xp_thumper_label=Thumper
@xp_thumper_descrip=You have equipped the Thumper grenade launcher rifle. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_thumper_message=THUMPER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Thumper is an extremely versatile grenade launcher since it can launch all three existing types of grenade ammo; fragmentation, jammer, and plasma.\n\nThus, if an operator keeps many grenade rounds in their inventory, the weapon can quickly be swapped to meet almost any situational need.  The presence of a Thumper expert on a squad should always be appreciated.

# MAX Weapon Messages
@xp_nc_hev_falcon_label=Falcon
@xp_nc_hev_falcon_descrip=You are equipped with the Falcon Rocket Launching System. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_nc_hev_falcon_message=FALCON\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis powerful rocket launcher fires a dumb-fire projectile that streaks toward its target and delivers a massive payload.\n\nThe warhead on the Falcon has a minimum safe distance it must travel before exploding. If fired within that range, the warhead will do kinetic damage only and will fail to detonate.
@xp_nc_hev_scattercannon_label=Scattercannon
@xp_nc_hev_scattercannon_descrip=You are equipped with the Scattercannon. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_nc_hev_scattercannon_message=SCATTERCANNON\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Scattercannon is similar to an incredibly large bore shotgun, with adjustable-on-the-fly zoom views and shot patterns.\n\nEssentially, each of the firing modes is slightly more zoomed in and a tighter spread than the one before.\n\nThe first firing mode is close range and with a very large spread. This is designed for close-in dirty work against evasive targets.\n\nThe second mode is a more general-use setting with a longer range, but a tighter pattern, requiring more finesse when aiming.\n\nThe third mode is long range and has an extremely tight firing pattern, making it useful for long-range delivery of impressive damage.
@xp_nc_hev_sparrow_label=Sparrow
@xp_nc_hev_sparrow_descrip=You are equipped with the Sparrow Missile Launching System. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_nc_hev_sparrow_message=SPARROW\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Sparrow takes a second or two to lock onto a target, but once locked, the missiles in its payload can be fired rapidly until lock is broken.\n\nOnly air targets can be locked, but the Sparrow Missiles can be launched dumbfire, if desired. Without the lock, they will only impact the target kinetically, doing reduced damage without exploding, but they can be used versus ground vehicles and infantry in desparate situations.
@xp_trhev_burster_label=Burster
@xp_trhev_burster_descrip=You are equipped with the anti-aircraft Burster system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_trhev_burster_message=BURSTER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Burster is often described as a potent, high-powered flak cannon.\n\nWhen operational, the Burster is constantly seeking air targets. Its shells are then programmed to detonate in near vicinity to that air target, thus allowing concentrated bursts of flak near the target. Repeated impacts from near-hits generally destroy the target.\n\nIf no air target is identified, the shells can still be fired. However, they will not explode at a pre-determined range and will impact inertially instead, for greatly reduced damage. However, this ability to fire without locking is quite handy when facing ground vehicles or infantry.\n\nTo greatly increase your rate-of-fire, anchor your suit. To move again after anchoring, you must un-anchor. This will restrict your field of fire, but you will be able to unleash a huge amount of ordnance that way.
@xp_trhev_dualcycler_label=Dual-Cycler
@xp_trhev_dualcycler_descrip=You are equipped with the Dual-Cycler anti-infantry weapon system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_trhev_dualcycler_message=DUAL-CYCLER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThese heavy chainguns fire simultaneously to fill a nearby area with a hail of lead projectiles.\n\nWhen the MAX is anchored, the rate-of-fire almost doubles, saturating an area in front of the MAX with high intensity firepower.\n\nThe ammunition used in the Dual-Cycler is best for 'soft' targets, but even armored vehicles eventually will fall to enough rounds.\n\nThe Dual-Cycler's chief drawback is its huge appetite for ammunition. Carry as much as you can. You'll need it.
@xp_trhev_pounder_label=Pounder
@xp_trhev_pounder_descrip=You are equipped with the anti-vehicular Pounder grenade launching system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_trhev_pounder_message=POUNDER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nWhen anchored, the TR MAX can launch light mortars in a rapid fashion, innundating a target area with explosion after explosion.\n\nEven when not anchored, the mortars can be used to continuously barrage an area for suppression fire or just general destruction.\n\nCarry as much ammunition as you can. You'll need it.
@xp_vshev_comet_label=Comet
@xp_vshev_comet_descrip=Your are equipped with the anti-vehicular Comet plasma projector. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_vshev_comet_message=COMET\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Comet shoots energy spheres of roiling plasma in a straight-line toward your target.\n\nWhen those spheres impact a surface, they detonate fiercely, causing explosive damage in that area.
@xp_vshev_quasar_label=Quasar
@xp_vshev_quasar_descrip=You are equipped with the Quasar anti-infantry weapon system. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_vshev_quasar_message=QUASAR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Quasar is a souped-up, more powerful version of the Pulsar hand-held rifle.\n\nLike most Vanu beam weapons, the Quasar can fire in both standard and armor-piercing modes and it does tremendous damage against most targets.\n\nAlthough still not as powerful against vehicles as the Comet configuration, the Quasar makes mincemeat of most infantry opponents.
@xp_vshev_starfire_label=Starfire
@xp_vshev_starfire_descrip=You are equipped with the Starfire anti-aircraft energy weapon. You are awarded 50 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_vshev_starfire_message=STARFIRE\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nWhen targeting aircraft, the Starfire can achieve a weapons lock.\n\nOnce lock is achieved, the plasma spheres launched by the Starfire will guide in on that target, impacting it and splashing it with aggravated damage (the plasma burns over time, destroying the target rapidly as it burns).\n\nIf no target lock is achieved, the Starfire plasma can be fired, but it will not explode on impact without a lock and does significantly less damage. However, this 'dumb-fire' mode can be very useful against ground vehicles and infantry in a desparate situation.

@xp_105mm_cannon_label=100mm Cannon
@xp_105mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 100mm Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_105mm_cannon_message=100mm CANNON\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis medium tank cannon lacks the power of the 150 mm Cannon, but enjoys a faster refire rate and moderate recoil penalties.
@xp_150mm_cannon_label=150mm Cannon
@xp_150mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 150mm Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_150mm_cannon_message=150mm CANNON\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe most powerful anti-vehicular cannon on a per shot basis, the 150 mm Cannon combines devastating power, proximity damage, and long range capabilities to make it an ideal anti-tank weapon.\n\nThe 150mm does suffer from a poor refire rate, but is nonetheless the king of vehicular cannons.
@xp_20mm_cannon_label=20mm Recoilless Chaingun
@xp_20mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 20mm Recoilless Chaingun. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_20mm_cannon_message=20mm RECOILLESS CHAINGUN\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nWhile this weapon doesn't have the blazing refire rate of the Rotary Chaingun, it nonetheless makes up for it with increased damage per shot and improved accuracy.\n\nThe 20 mm Recoilless Chaingun can be used effectively against infantry as well as lightly armored vehicles, even over long range.
@xp_75mm_cannon_label=75mm Cannon
@xp_75mm_cannon_descrip=You are manning the 75mm Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_75mm_cannon_message=75mm CANNON\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe 75mm launches explosive shells that inflict moderate damage against vehicles and high damage against infantry.\n\nA reasonable refire rate gives the 75mm a somewhat balanced role as both anti-vehicular and anti-infantry.\n\nEach shell is explosive and causes damage to all targets within a small area.
@xp_firebird_label=Firebird Rocket Launcher
@xp_firebird_descrip=You are manning the Firebird Advanced Rocket Launching (ARL) System. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_firebird_message=FIREBIRD ROCKET LAUNCHER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nLaunching potent rockets at a fairly rapid rate, the Firebird is extremely useful when mounted on mobile armor.\n\nThe refire rate is average, but each rocket delivers both solid damage and a reasonable proximity effect when exploding.\n\nThe projectiles travel at a fairly swift rate when launched, but are best used against close- to medium-range vehicular targets. Targets at longer ranges can generally undertake evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit by a Firebird rocket.
@xp_flux_cannon_label=Flux Cannon
@xp_flux_cannon_descrip=You are manning the Flux Cannon. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_flux_cannon_message=FLUX CANNON\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies.\n\nWhile an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate.\n\nWhen fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@xp_heavy_grenade_launcher_label=GroundPounder
@xp_heavy_grenade_launcher_descrip=You are manning the GroundPounder. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_heavy_grenade_launcher_message=GROUNDPOUNDER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe GroundPounder inflicts most of its damage through proximity radius.\n\nWhen fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases in a linear manner to the proximity's edge.\n\nDue to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@xp_heavy_rail_beam_label=Heavy Rail Beam
@xp_heavy_rail_beam_descrip=You are manning the Heavy Rail Beam. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_heavy_rail_beam_message=HEAVY RAIL BEAM\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nExtremely precise and powerful, the Heavy Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects.\n\nThe Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@xp_lightning_weapons_label=Lightning Weapons Systems
@xp_lightning_weapons_descrip=You are driving the Lightning and have access to its weapon systems.
@xp_lightning_weapons_message=LIGHTNING WEAPON SYSTEMS\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Lightning carries both a 75mm Cannon and 12mm Rotary Chaingun for the driver to use.\n\nThe cannon is best used for vehicular and MAX targets, while the chaingun is best for mowing down infantry targets.
@xp_phalanx_label=Phalanx Wall Turret
@xp_phalanx_descrip=You are operating a wall turret. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_phalanx_message=PHALANX WALL TURRET\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe wall turrets employ a Phalanx chaingun system.\n\nWith ammunition supplied from below the turret within the wall, the turret has virtually endless ammunition and is extremely effective against incoming invaders.
@xp_pulsed_particle_accelerator_label=Pulsed Particle Accelerator
@xp_pulsed_particle_accelerator_descrip=You are manning the Pulsed Particle Accelerator.
@xp_pulsed_particle_accelerator_message=PULSED PARTICLE ACCELERATOR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially a laser machine gun.\n\nThe individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic.\n\nThe pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they begin to dissipate.\n\nAs with the Rotary Chaingun and 20mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@xp_reaver_weapons_label=Reaver Weapon Systems
@xp_reaver_weapons_descrip=You are piloting the Reaver and have access to its weapon systems. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_reaver_weapons_message=REAVER WEAPONS SYSTEMS\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Reaver gunship has both a 20mm Recoilless Chaingun and Rocket Launchers beneath its wings.\n\nThe rockets are best used versus vehicular and MAX targets, while the chaingun is better for softer infantry targets.
@xp_rotarychaingun_label=12mm Rotary Chaingun
@xp_rotarychaingun_descrip=You have access to the 12mm Rotary Chaingun You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.
@xp_rotarychaingun_message=12mm ROTARY CHAINGUN\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nYour forward-firing weapon is the 12mm Rotary Chaingun.\n\nIt is useful against infantry targets and some light armor.\n\nIt consumes ammunition at a fairly rapid rate, so it's wise to stock extra ammo in the trunk so that you can reload in the field.
@xp_vanguard_weapons_label=Vanguard Weapons Systems
@xp_vanguard_weapons_descrip=You are manning the gunnery position on a Vanguard heavy tank. You are awarded 30 BEP for using this weapon the first time.

@xp_ams_message=ADVANCED MOBILE STATION (AMS)\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nTo deploy an AMS in the field, first bring the vehicle to a complete stop, then go to the front of the vehicle, on the 'deploy' mount circle, and hit the Use Key.\n\nThis will deploy the respawn tubes and equipment terminal for action.\n\nTo make the AMS mobile again, you must first un-deploy the vehicle. This is done by the same process as deploying the vehicle in the first place.\n\nNote also that anyone who binds to the respawn tubes on the AMS will be unable to respawn there if the vehicle is in motion. The vehicle must be deployed in order for the respawn tubes to function.
@xp_ant_label=Advanced Nanite Transport
@xp_ant_descrip=You are facing an Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT). You are awarded 50 BEP for investigating this vehicle for the first time.
@xp_ant_message=ADVANCED NANITE TRANSPORT (ANT)\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe ANT is used to gather energy resources from warp gate bubbles and bring those resources to battle facilities for use as power.\n\nTo gather energy, the ANT is driven within a warp gate bubble. Once there, it deploys its collector vanes and gathers the ancient Vanu nanite energy replicators.\n\nThat cargo of nanites is then driven to a base facility and the ANT is deployed near the base's Silo.\n\nThe nanites are then transmitted to the base facility on a carrier beam.\n\nOnce inside the Silo, the nanites begin their work of replicating energy for use by the facility, but the human tech interface (Silo) is imperfect and doesn't seem to sustain the nanites for some reason, so they eventually perish and have to be replenished for the Silos to be effective.
@xp_apc_label=Sunderer
@xp_apc_descrip=You are facing the Sunderer large ground transport vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_apc_message=SUNDERER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Sunderer can carry a driver, two MAXs, six passengers, and two gunners.\n\nThis allows the flexibility for a driver to ferry a full squad of passengers to a destination, if desired.\n\nThe two guns on the Sunderer are 75mm Cannons which do heavy damage against vehicles, and moderate damage against infantry.
@xp_dropship_label=Galaxy
@xp_dropship_descrip=You are facing the Galaxy large transport aircraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_dropship_message=GALAXY\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Galaxy aircraft can carry a pilot, two MAXs, six passengers, two wing gunners, a tailgunner, and a light assault vehicle with up to three passengers, bringing the maximum total personnel carried up to 15 people.\n\nThis is plenty of room for a regular flight crew (pilot and three gunners), and a full squad as passengers.\n\nVehicles that can be carried include: Harasser, Lightning, Thresher(VS), Enforcer(TR), Marauder(NC).
@xp_lightgunship_label=Reaver
@xp_lightgunship_descrip=You are facing the Reaver armored attack aircraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_lightgunship_message=REAVER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis aircraft is more heavily armored and armed than it's scout-cousin, the Mosquito.\n\nThis armor and weaponry comes at the price of agility and speed, as well as the fact that enemy radar easily picks up the Reaver as a target.\n\nHowever, the Reaver carries both the 20mm chaingun and twin Rocket Launchers.\n\nThese pods can deliver catastrophic damage to vehicles, while the machine gun is best used against softer targets.\n\nThe Reaver also sports an afterburner that affords it temporary surges in forward velocity.\n\nThe afterburner draws on a specially integrated capacitor, which slowly recharges each time the afterburner is used.
@xp_lightning_label=Lightning
@xp_lightning_descrip=You are facing the Lightning light armor assault vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_lightning_message=LIGHTNING\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Lightning's best asset is its mobility. The vehicle is lightly armored and must keep moving to avoid the damage potential of other, heavier vehicles on the battlefield.\n\nThe lightning carries two weapons; the 12mm rotary chaingun, and the 75mm anti-vehicle cannon.\n\nBoth weapons are mounted on forward-swiveling, driver-controlled turrets for ease of use while driving.
@xp_magrider_label=Magrider
@xp_magrider_descrip=You are facing the Magrider heavy armor assault hovercraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_magrider_message=MAGRIDER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Magrider is large and slow, but heavily armored and with lateral maneuverability that non-hovercraft can't match.\n\nThe tank carries both the Heavy Rail Beam and the Particle Beam Cannon.\n\nThe Heavy Rail Beam can rapidly decimate infantry targets with its energy beam, while the Particle Beam Cannon carries the punching power to penetrate even heavy armor on enemy hard targets.\n\nWith its hover technology, the Magrider can also cross small waterways, smoothly gliding over the surface.\n\nHowever, in doing so, the Magrider stabilizes itself with air jets that automatically engage over water and has a decreased top speed.\n\nThe air jets have limited capacity, and if depleted the Magrider will literally sink into the water.\n\nFortunately when back over land the air jet capacitor will slowly recharge.
@xp_mediumtransport_label=Deliverer
@xp_mediumtransport_descrip=You are facing the Deliverer transport vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_mediumtransport_message=DELIVERER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Deliverer is designed to deliver half a squad to a destination with rapid speed and mobility.\n\nIt is more lightly armored and armed than its behemoth cousin, the Sunderer.\n\nIt has two weapon mounts equipped with 20mm chainguns to repel infantry attacks, but should avoid engagements with heavy armor as neither its weapons nor its armor are up to that task.\n\nThe Deliverer is also an amphibious vehicle, capable of crossing waterways.\n\nWhen in water, the Deliverer suffers from extreme drag, still using its wheels for propulsion, and is only capable of achieving a small measure of its top speed.\n\nThis makes the Deliverer quite vulnerable when crossing water, although the amphibious benefit can often be invaluable for travel in general.
@xp_mosquito_label=Mosquito
@xp_mosquito_descrip=You are facing a Mosquito scouting aircraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_mosquito_message=MOSQUITO\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Mosquito's primary advantages are its stealth capability (it is very difficult to see a Mosquito on radar), its speed and agility, as well as its overflight ability that lets objects it overflies appear on radar so that squadmates can gather intelligence information.\n\nThe Mosquito is equipped with a 12mm rotary chaingun, but should only use it for anti-air engagements, or for light strafing on infantry targets.
@xp_prowler_label=Prowler
@xp_prowler_descrip=You are facing the Prowler heavy armor assault vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_prowler_message=PROWLER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis is the heaviest tank in the Terran Republic arsenal. A three-man crew drives the tank and mans the weapon platforms.\n\nThe 100mm cannon has high penetrating power against hard targets, while the dual 12mm Rotary Chaingun can make quick work of lightly armored and unarmored targets.
@xp_quadassault_label=Basilisk
@xp_quadassault_descrip=You are facing the Basilisk light scout vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_quadassault_message=BASILISK\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Basilisk is a great vehicle for going from Point A to Point B as rapidly as possible. It even has a light, forward-sweeping 12mm rotary chaingun for its driver to use.\n\nHowever, the open structure of the Basilisk, combined with its almost complete lack of armor, makes it a poor choice to ride when entering a contested battlefield.
@xp_quadstealth_label=Wraith
@xp_quadstealth_descrip=You are facing the Wraith light stealth vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_quadstealth_message=WRAITH\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis is the cloaking version of the Basilisk.\n\nWhen a rider wearing an Infiltration Suit is riding the Wraith, the on-board systems can be plugged into the rider's suit to enable the vehicle and suit to cloak together at the same time. Of course, like regular Infilitration Suit cloaking, the faster the vehicle moves, the lower the effectiveness of the vehicle's cloak.\n\nCurrently, weapon systems have caused too much interference with the Wraith's cloaking engine, so no weapons are mounted to the Wraith.
@xp_threemanheavybuggy_label=Marauder
@xp_threemanheavybuggy_descrip=You are facing the Marauder light armor support vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_threemanheavybuggy_message=MARAUDER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis three-man buggy has more armor, and two mounted weapons for gunners to operate.\n\nHighly mobile, but still not heavy enough to qualify as a tank, the Marauder can still do a serious amount of damage on the battlefield.\n\nThe 12mm Chaingun, used from the side passenger seat, as well as the GroundPounder Launcher mounted in the rear turret of the vehicle, make this buggy lethal against both infantry and hard targets up to lightly armored tanks.
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_label=Harasser
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_descrip=You are facing the Harasser light armor scout vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_message=HARASSER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Harasser is a light harrying vehicle designed for rapid transit, as well as hit-and-run assaults designed to keep the enemy off-balance.\n\nThe two-man buggy carries a 12mm rotary chaingun in the gunner seat for use against soft targets, while the driver concentrates on keeping this lightly armored vehicle operational.
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_label=Enforcer
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_descrip=You are facing the Enforcer light armor support vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_message=ENFORCER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis lightly armored buggy sports a Firebird advanced rocket launcher system in a rear turret, making it a powerful opponent to heavy armor.\n\nWhile it can't take a punch well, it's light profile and weight make it a difficult target for heavy ordnance to home in upon and make this vehicle something that tank commanders fear.
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_label=Thresher
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_descrip=You are facing the Thresher light armor scout hovercraft. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_message=THRESHER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis light hovercraft has a Flux Cannon mounted in the passenger position for use against infantry and light armor.\n\nThe hovercraft abilities allow this vehicle to travel for short periods over water, as well as allowing it to strafe left and right across open terrain, thus making it extremely maneuverable.\n\nWhen crossing water, the Thresher stabilizes itself with air jets that automatically engage over water and has a decreased top speed.\n\nThe air jets have limited capacity, and if depleted the Thresher will literally sink into the water.\n\nFortunately when back over land the air jet capacitor will slowly recharge.
@xp_vanguard_label=Vanguard
@xp_vanguard_descrip=You are facing the Vanguard heavy armor assault vehicle. You are awarded 70 BEP for investigating this vehicle the first time.
@xp_vanguard_message=VANGUARD\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis heavy tank is the largest in the arsenal of the New Conglomerate.\n\nIts speed is decent despite its heavy armor plating and it's two weapons platforms make it formidable on the field.\n\nThe 20mm Chaingun prevents infantry from being able to close with the vehicle easily, while the 150mm Cannon, the largest weapon available anywhere, decimates enemy armor targets.

# Equipment Help Messages
@xp_ace_label=Adaptive Construction Engine (ACE)
@xp_ace_descrip=You have equipped the Adaptive Construction Engine (ACE).  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_ace_message=ADAPTIVE CONSTRUCTION ENGINE (ACE)\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nUsing adaptive nano-bot construction methods the device can create structures such as Boomers, HE Mines, Spitfire turrets, and Motion Sensor Alarms with high speed and accuracy.\n\nOnce the ACE is equipped in-hand, any of those four items can be deployed by looking down at the ground and placing the item.\n\nThe particular device to be deployed can be selected by cycling through the 'firing modes' of the ACE.\n\nIf you have the ACE in-hand and look down, your reticule will change from red to green whenever you are in a legal deployment zone.\n\nIf you press the fire button while the reticule is green, the object will deploy properly.\n\nNote: HE Mines, and Spitfires may not be deployed indoors. Boomers and Motion Sensors may be deployed on any level surface, whether indoors or outdoors.
@xp_bank_label=Body Armor Nano-Kit (BANK)
@xp_bank_descrip=You have equipped the Body Armor Nano-Kit (BANK).  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_bank_message=BODY ARMOR NANO-KIT (BANK)\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis energy projector is specifically designed to stimulate the nanites within Standard Armor, Agile and Reinforced Exosuits, as well as the heavier plating of Mechanized Assault eXo-suits.\n\nOnce the energy stimulates those nanites, they go into a period of hyperactivity, restoring the original matrix of the armor and bringing it back to its full protective capabilities.\n\nThe BANK can be used on other friendly soldiers (primary mode), as well as on yourself (secondary mode).
@xp_med_app_label=Medical Applicator
@xp_med_app_descrip=You have equipped the Medical Applicator.  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_med_app_message=MEDICAL APPLICATOR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Medical Applicator is tied tightly into the Vanu respawning technology.\n\nThis hand-held device is an energy projector (like the BANK) that stimulates nanites within the flesh of soldiers, but also communicates (via human tech interfaces) with the Vanu tech at the core of the planet.\n\nThus, the med applicator can restore the matrix of the living tissue of a soldier, as well as actually revive the lifespark within a recently dead soldier.\n\nThere are two firing modes for the med applicator. Primary firing heals and revives other soldiers, while the secondary mode can heal yourself.\n\n To successfully revive a fallen comrade, you must use the med applicator on them BEFORE they release to go back to a respawn point.\n\nIn otherwords, if you see a friendly corpse on the ground, you can revive the slain soldier. If you see nothing but a loot box, then it's too late and they've already released for respawn.
@xp_nano_dispenser_label=Nano-Dispenser
@xp_nano_dispenser_descrip=You have equipped the Nano-Dispenser.  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_nano_dispenser_message=NANO-DISPENSER\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Nano-Dispenser assesses a target in need of repair, configures nanites to work on that target, and then projects a beam on which the nanites travel to the target. The excited energy beam provides a power source for those nanites, allowing them to repair almost any static object or vehicle until the power beam is stopped.\n\nThe nano-dispenser can be used to repair the armor of all vehicles, equipment terminals, and deployable objects.\n\nTo repair an object, merely point the nano-dispenser at that target and press the fire key.
@xp_rek_label=Remote Electronics Kit (REK)
@xp_rek_descrip=You have equipped the Remote Electronics Kit (REK).  You are awarded 70 BEP for using this equipment for the first time.
@xp_rek_message=REMOTE ELECTRONICS KIT (REK)\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe Remote Electronics Kit is used for hacking enemy equipment and capturing base facilities.\n\nThe REK is more useful as a hacker becomes skilled with it, but even to non-hackers, it is still quite handy.\n\nAbilities for non-hackers include hacking open external door locks and capturing facilities.\n\nSoldiers with a Hacking certification can hack doors and capture terminals more rapidly, and also can hack the various Facility terminals so that they can be used by friendlies for a short period of time.\n\nSoldiers with Advanced Hacking certifications can do everything a Hacker can do, but faster\n\nIf an Advanced Hacker hacks a terminal, it also stays hacked longer than if hacked by someone with just Hacking certification.\n\nThe REK can also be used to steal ('jack') unoccupied enemy vehicles.\n\nThe amount of time it takes to steal the vehicle is dependent on the vehicle type. Typically the smaller the vehicle, the less time required to transfer ownership, whereas the larger the vehicle, the more time required to transfer ownership.\n\nAdvanced Hackers benefit greatly when stealing enemy vehicles, as their certification allows them to swiftly complete the theft.

@xp_map03_descrip=You have arrived at Cyssor. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map03_message=CYSSOR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe quakes that still rattle Cyssor shook this continent until it broke and the pieces that remain look more like islands than an intact continent.\n\nBridges span the many waterways on this island continent and it still has the tallest mountain on the planet.\n\nWily commanders will recognize the many traffic flow bottlenecks and the centrally located Dropship Center in the middle of Cyssor.
@xp_map04_label=Visit Ishundar
@xp_map04_descrip=You have arrived at Ishundar. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map04_message=ISHUNDAR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis continent is extremely arid and inhospitable to life. Its salt-water lakes are the only break in the unending bleakness that is Ishundar.\n\nThe continent is split in two by a gigantic canyon valley between the two highlands in Ishundar's center, making traffic flows between the two halves more predictable and creating bottlenecks for tacticians to exploit.

@xp_map05_message=FORSERAL\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis sprawling continent is temperate in nature. Lakes dot the map, and peaks jut up into the sky. Easy cover for infantry is found in groves of trees and ravines, while vehicles need to watch for ambushes from those same places.
@xp_map06_label=Visit Ceryshen
@xp_map06_descrip=You have arrived at Ceryshen. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map06_message=CERYSHEN\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe permafrost terrain on this continent is extremely vertical. Cliffs abound, and a misplaced footstep can send you hurtling to your doom. Air vehicles can cross this terrain quickly, but foot soldiers and ground vehicles find that many miles lay between point A and point B due to successive switchbacks and roundabout roads.

@xp_map07_message=ESAMIR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe dense snow-covered forests, low visibility and rolling hills make this continent difficult for off-road vehicles and makes infantry tactics more common than massed armor.\n\nEsamir is the largest of the island continents on Auraxis.
@xp_map08_label=Visit Oshur
@xp_map08_descrip=You have arrived at Oshur. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map08_message=OSHUR\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThis extremely rough desert continent consists of the broken bones of an impact crater. The rough badlands and choppy terrain make it relatively easy to hide fairly large forces in what seems to be plain view.\n\nA giant, unexplained avian skeleton lies fossilized on the continent, giving rise to lively discussions about the Vanu that were here before.

@xp_map09_descrip=You have arrived at Searhus. You are awarded 100 BEP for visiting this continent for the first time.
@xp_map09_message=SEARHUS\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe center of this continent is a gigantic volcanic caldera. The bases inside that crater are an obvious stronghold on the continent, but to keep those bases secure, the facilities on the rim of the caldera should be secured as well. Beware the lava pools! They are extremely unforgiving.
@xp_map10_label=Visit Amerish

This island is secured from enemy invasion by the encrypted warpgates connecting it to other continents.\n\nUnlike the more general warpgates elsewhere in the world, the secure gates only respond to the identichip embedded in your skull, thus only allowing members of your Empire to pass into this Sanctuary.\n\nThe Sanctuary has everything you need to launch a full-scale campaign against your Empire's enemies. Ground vehicles, air vehicles, the giant Galaxy dropships, armor, weapons, equipment, implants, and even training terminals are all available here in the Sanctuary complex.\n\nWander about. Look for the floating Auraxis icon over the terminals...those icons are indicators of something you haven't seen before, and they'll give you information if you get close to them and look at them.\n\nWhen you are fully outfitted, take a moment to talk to other soldiers here. Join or form a squad. And when you're ready, you can either take one of the HART shuttles and drop pod down to the planet somewhere, or you can grab vehicles and head to one of the three Warp Gates in the area to jump to other continents.\n\nBe sure to use your overhead map function to navigate around.

@xp_warp_gate_descrip=You have used a 'broadcast' warpgate for the first time to go from your Empire's Sanctuary to another continent. You are awarded 200 BEP.
@xp_warp_gate_message=BROADCAST WARPGATES\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nMost warpgates are locked so they go from one specific warpgate to another.\n\nThe warpgates in your Sanctuary are different. They can be used to transport to ANY warpgate in the world, *except* for warpgates on locked continents or warpgates on Enemy Sanctuaries.\n\nOnce you've entered a broadcast warpgate, the global map comes up. Double-click a destination continent so that it zooms to continent view.\n\nThen just click on any of the blinking warpgate icons to select a destination.\n\nYou'll immediately warp there.

You are now authorized to requisition a Command Uplink device from any Equipment Terminal.
@xp_command_rank_3_label=Command Rank Three
@xp_command_rank_3_descrip=You have achieved Command Rank Three (CR3).

This allows you to easily discuss issues with commanders of your level or above and to tie in to global strategies.\n\nAdditionally, you can now draw directly on your overhead map and transmit, in real-time, the battleplans you draw to your ENTIRE Squad or Outfit.\n\nYou also now have the ability to project a small Jamming Radius (via your Command Uplink device) that blocks enemy CR 4 and 5 commanders from using their SEE ALL ENEMY abilities to find you.\n\nNote: Those enemy commanders WILL see a jammed area...but they won't know what's in that jammed area.
@xp_command_rank_4_label=Command Rank Four
@xp_command_rank_4_descrip=You have achieved Command Rank Four (CR4).
@xp_command_rank_4_message=COMMAND RANK FOUR!\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nCongratulations, you've reached a level that few achieve.\n\nYou now have the ability to broadcast to the Continent you stand upon so that you can inform all friendlies on that continent about emergency situations.\n\nAdditionally, every 20 minutes, you can now SEE ALL ENEMIES via your Command Uplink device. You'll be able to see all enemies within a large radius around you. This data can be obsoleted quickly, but can provide you with a quick snapshot of the tactical situation.\n\nYour Jamming ability radius has now been increased due to the new rank.\n\nYou also have the ability to call down an Orbital Strike from your Empire's station high above Auraxis. This is done via the Command Uplink device, and the Strike will impact on whatever site you have 'painted' with the Uplink device's beam.\n\nThe Strike is quite powerful, but localized, so pick your targets carefully.

You can global broadcast to ALL friendlies, if so desired, or broadcast to all friendlies on any one specific continent.\n\nAdditionally, you have been granted the ultimate Orbital Strike access and can call down much more powerful attacks now.

@xp_instant_action_label=Using Instant Action
@xp_instant_action_descrip=You have chosen Instant Action (or 'Request Deployment') for the first time.
@xp_instant_action_message=INSTANT ACTION\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nYou are seeing this message because you just selected 'Instant Action' from the Character Creation screens or you just chose 'Request Deployment' from the ESCAPE menu.\n\nYou have just been transported to a 'hot spot' somewhere in the world. You're currently in the basement of a friendly facility, but a battle is raging nearby.\n\nTo find the battle, hit 'M' to open your map screen and look for the nearby flashing Hot Spot indicator.\n\nNote the compass direction to that battle and then head on over there. Once you find the battle, you'll be able to figure out who is involved and what sort of fight is occurring. Enjoy!

@xp_drop_pod_label=Using a Drop Pod
@xp_drop_pod_descrip=You are using an Orbital Drop Pod for the first time.
@xp_drop_pod_message=USING A DROP POD\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nNow that you've entered a Drop Pod, you need to select your Drop Zone so you can launch from the HART and land on your chosen continent.\n\nTo select a Drop Zone, first double-click on one of the continents you see on the Global Map.\n\nThis takes you to the Continent View for that continent.\n\nJust single-click anywhere on the map to indicate a Drop Zone and then click the DROP button in the lower, right of the screen. You'll immediately launch after you click that button.\n\nThere is no way to leave the HART shuttle other than to drop to the surface below, so suck it up soldier and DROP!

@xp_overhead_map_label=Using the World Map
@xp_overhead_map_descrip=You are using the World Map for the first time.
@xp_overhead_map_message=USING THE WORLD MAP\n\n(Hit ESC to clear this dialog)\n\nThe World Map is your key to situational awareness around the planet of Auraxis.\n\nThe Global view shows you all 10 continents (plus the three Sanctuaries). On each continent, you'll see blinking starbursts that indicate large battles occurring on those continents. Go there if you want to head directly into action.\n\nThere is a Legend on the screen showing you what each of the map symbols mean, as well as two toolbars you can use to manipulate the map.\n\nThe Map Toolbar lets you easily switch between Global and Continent views, lets you zoom in and out (you can also use mouse wheel to zoom), and lets you set waypoints.\n\nThe other toolbar, the 'Toggle Visible' bar, lets you toggle on/off the various informational overlays on the map.\n\nExperiment with this interface for a bit. It's very powerful and the more you know about how to use it, the better you'll do during battle.

# MAIN HELP
#--------------------------
@HelpTitle=PlanetSide Help
@HelpHelp=Help on Help
@HelpHelpText=The help system is available to answer common questions about PlanetSide and its user interface.
@HelpHelpItem=Index
@HelpHelpItemText=The list on the left is the index of available help topics. Double-click an item to selct it.
@HelpHelpContext=Context
@HelpHelpContextText=The '?' on many user interface items will bring you to the appropriate help topic for that window.
@HelpArmor=Armor
@HelpArmorText=*** Armor ***
@HelpImplants=Implants
@HelpImplantsText=*** Implants ***
@HelpFrontend=Starting Screens
@HelpFrontendText=The 'Starting Screens' are the screens used to select your Empire, create your characters and select your characters for entry into a world. The Server Select screen is also described here.
@HelpFrontendServer=Server Select
@HelpFrontendServerText=This window lists the available Worlds you can choose.\n\nSelect a World and hit the NEXT button in the lower, right of the screen in order to connect to that World and begin a career in PlanetSide.\n\nYou can sort any of the columns by left-clicking the column's name. That way you can easily find which server has the best ping, most players, or which Empire needs players.\n\nThe 'Empire Needs' column shows you if one of the three Empires needs more characters on that particular server to balance the world. You will usually receive incentives (bonuses) for joining an underdog Empire.
@HelpFrontendEmpire=Empire Select
@HelpFrontendEmpireText=The war rages between three different Empires; the Terran Republic, the New Conglomerate, and the Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nRead more about them by clicking on their respective logo buttons in the center of the screen.\n\nNOTE: You can only create characters from a single empire on any particular world server.\n\nOnce you choose an Empire, that's your choice on that given world unless you first delete all your characters from your current empire on this world server.\n\nTo select an Empire, click it, and then press the NEXT button in the lower, right of the screen.
@HelpFrontendCharacter=Character Select
@HelpFrontendCharacterText=The soldiers you have created for the selected World are available on this screen. Select one by clicking on that soldier's name.\n\nTo enter the world and begin play click the NEXT button in the lower right of the screen.\n\nTo delete the character, click the delete circle under the bottom character slot.
@HelpFrontendCreate=Character Creation
@HelpFrontendCreateText=You create your soldiers here.\n\nEnter your soldier's name in the space provided at the top of the screen.\n\nThen select a gender (male/female) by clicking the appropriate gender button.\n\nSelect a face by scrolling through the available faces, and then pick a voice for your soldier by clicking and listening to the various voice sets avialable.\n\nWhen you have all your choices made, click the right arrow in the lower, right of the screen in order to save the soldier and enter the world.
@HelpFrontendInstantAction=Instant Action
@HelpFrontendInstantActionText=When you choose Instant Action, you are voluntarily deconstructing your soldier and allowing your Empire to determine where you would be best used to advance their causes.\n\nWhen this happens, you will be reconstructed in a facility or tower near to a "hot spot" on the continent.\n\nThat hotspot is easily seen. Your personal waypoint is placed on that hotspot upon your arrival, so you can find the battle you've been directed toward by just heading to the waypoint.\n\nThere are no guarantees what part of the world Instant Action will take you to...that's all dependent upon where the major battles are on Auraxis.
@HelpOptions=Options
@HelpOptionsText=This category provides information designed to refine and alter your game's performance characteristics, sound playback, keyboard layout, and more.\n\nClick on each of the areas indicated here to see the options available.
@HelpOptionKeymap=Keymapping
@HelpOptionKeymapText=****KEYMAPPINGS****
@HelpOptionVideo=Video Options
@HelpOptionVideoText=****VIDEO OPTIONS****.
@HelpOptionSound=Sound Options
@HelpOptionSoundText=****SOUND OPTIONS****
@HelpOptionOther=Other Options
@HelpOptionOtherText=****OTHER OPTIONS****
@HelpHUDView=HUD Elements
@HelpHUDViewText=In general, all the elements you see on your Heads-Up Display (HUD) are described in this chapter.
@HelpHUDActiveItems=Holsters
@HelpHUDActiveItemsText=Any weapons you have at your disposal are shown in the form of 'Holsters' in the bar at the bottom of your screen.\n\nYou can activate a Holster by tapping the appropriate number key (1-4).\n\nIf you are in individual armor (Infiltration, Standard, Agile, Reinforced or MAX), you are equipping an available weapon into your hand so that you can fire. In a vehicle, this 'holster' indicates the weapon you have at your vehicle position (if available).\n\nThe 'dots' next to the weapon indicate firing modes. The top dot is your Primary fire mode, the second one is your Secondary fire mode, etc.\n\nThe icon directly below your holster is the type of ammunition you currently have loaded into the weapon.\n\nThe number to the left of that ammo type icon is the number of shots you have left in your clip. (NOTE: This is also indicated by the filled area behind your weapon icon in the holster area just for a quick-glance representation.)\n\nThe number to the right of the ammo icon is how many shots of that type you have left in your *inventory* so that you know how many shots you have remaining.\n\nThe weapon you currently have equipped has a highlighted holster so you can easily see that information at a glance.
@HelpHUDCharacterPane=Character Info Screen
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneText=The default key to open your Character pane is "O". On this pane you'll see your soldier's name, battle rank, command rank, certification points remaining to be spent, current grief point totals, as well as the various certifications you possess.\n\nAdditionally, your current Implants are shown on this screen. A hotkey for your implant is automatically created on your hotbar so that you can easily activate it by tapping the appropriate F-key.\n\nAdditionally, a button at the bottom of this pane takes you to your Character Statistics. This is the area where you can track all of your kill stats, your capture stats, etc. Take a look. There's a lot of information there.
@HelpHUDCorpse=Death & Respawn
@HelpHUDCorpseText=When you are killed, your body collapses to the ground as a 'corpse'. Don't worry...it's a temporary situation.\n\nYou'll immediately see a progress bar that takes quite a while to elapse. If that bar gets all the way to the end, you will automatically respawn and appear at your Sanctuary.\n\nHowever, you can single-click on any of the respawn locations indicated on the Respawn Interface and, after a short wait, you'll respawn at that facility, whether it be a deployed AMS, Facility or Tower.\n\nIf you don't choose a respawn location, and your auto-timer hasn't expired, then Advanced Medics can Revive you on the spot. They will come to your corpse, use their medical applicator, and if you allow it, you can be Revived immediately without being transported to a respawn location. Handy, eh?
@HelpHUDDamage=Damage Indicators
@HelpHUDDamageText=The area around your crosshairs (reticule) flashes red whenever you take damage.\n\nThe red arcs you see indicate the direction the attack is coming from, so if you watch those indicators, you can quickly turn to face your attacker and return fire.
@HelpHUDEquipment=Equipment Terminal
@HelpHUDEquipmentText=****EQUIPMENT TERMINAL****
@HelpHUDExclamation=Exclamation Training
@HelpHUDExclamationText=When you first encounter something that is useful in the game (weapon, vehicle, terminal, capture console, generator, etc.), you will often see a three-pointed Auraxis symbol floating over the top of it.\n\nThis indicates that there is special 'help' information available there.\n\nIf you approach the object, and look straight at it, a dialog box will appear with infomation on how to use that item. (In the case of weapons, it comes up when you equip them.)\n\nTake a few moments to read these dialogs. They contain a great deal of information about how to use each item and will help you shorten your learning curve so you can just enjoy the game.\n\nAdditionally, as an incentive, the first-time help dialogs all come with an experience bonus. If you activate those help dialogs, you will get Battle Experience to help you gain rank.
@HelpHUDImplant=Implant Terminal
@HelpHUDImplantText=You receive available Implant slots at Battle Ranks 6, 12, and 18.\n\nThe only place you can fill those slots, however, is at an Implant Terminal. These terminals are available only at Bio Labs and the Sanctuary.\n\nTo use an Implant Terminal, just step onto the mount circle and press 'G' to enter the terminal.\n\nYou'll then see a screen allowing you to browse through the Implants, getting information on each of them. You can easily add or remove implants via this interface.\n\nNOTE: When you first install an Implant, it has an activation timer that must expire before the Implant will function.\n\nYour Implant's activation timer must also expire after each time you die, so be warned that you are slightly less capable immediately after death because of this.
@HelpHUDInventory=Inventory
@HelpHUDInventoryText=The Inventory pane is fairly self-explanatory, but some quick notes are appropriate.\n\nYou can left-click an object to pick it up, and then just left-click elsewhere to drop it.\n\nTo destroy an object, pick it up and then place it on the 'Destroy' button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nYou can drop an object to the ground by clicking the object and placing it on the 'Drop' button.\n\nIf you are configuring Favorites, or just want to quickly clean out your inventory, then the 'Clear All' button can be very useful. Using this button will empty out all inventory from both the grid and all avaialble holsters. You can then easily start from scratch buying equipment from a terminal or looting it from another player.\n\nThere is a 'Use Item' button, but it is mostly included for completeness. You can use an item by selecting it and then moving it to this button, or you can do it by right-clicking the object (which uses it immediately).\n\nThe easiest way to use a medkit, however, is to tap the appropriate F-key to activate the hotkey that is automatically created the first time you put a medkit in your inventory.
@HelpHUDLocker=Lockers
@HelpHUDLockerText=Lockers are often critical, either when the generator is destroyed in your facility and all the equipment terminals lose power, or you enter a Tower which has lockers.\n\nLockers initially start completely empty. The only way they gain items is if you put them there.\n\nItems stored in Lockers are available at ANY lockers as long as the building housing the lockers is controlled by your Empire.\n\nLockers are persistent and the items placed there will be available the each time you log in.
@HelpHUDOutfit=Oufits
@HelpHUDOutfitText=****OUTFITS****
@HelpHUDOutfitList=Outfit Listings
@HelpHUDOutfitListText=****OUTFIT LISTINGS****
@HelpHUDPlayerPane=Player Info
@HelpHUDPlayerPaneText=This window lets you manage your squad, look for squad members (or look for a squad invitation if you're not forming a squad), as well as letting you manage your Friends list.\n\nThe leftmost tab is your Squad Management pane. It shows you all squad members, allows you to promote one of them to become squad leader, kick players out of the squad, and even leave the squad yourself.\n\nThe middle tab is your Friends List. Shown here is a complete list of your friends, as well as their on-line status. You can invite, kick, or even open a mini-window that shows your friends and on-line status at a glance.\n\nThe right-most tab is the 'Looking for Squad' pane. To indicate that you're looking for a squad, just click the LOOKING button and folks will start to see you as available.\n\nIf you're a squad leader, you can advertise that you *need* people, or certain certifications, by clicking the LOOKING button.\n\nWhether you're looking for a squad or trying to fill one up, you can be very specific about what certifications you're advertising as available or looking to get into your squad.
@HelpHUDRadar=Proximity Map
@HelpHUDRadarText=This 'mini-map' allows you to see, at a glance, the area around you as you move through the world.\n\nThe map can be zoomed to three different levels, from 50m diameter to 200m diamter. It will also show the interiors of buildings once you enter them for ease of navigation.\n\nCompass directions are shown for visual reference and your radar imaging will pick up enemy vehicles and show their icons there as well.\n\nSquadmates are indicated by number on the map, if they're close enough, and other friendlies are represented by dots.\n\nNOTE: If it's a red icon of any type...it's an enemy. Beware.
@HelpHUDReticle=Weapon Reticule
@HelpHUDReticleText=Your weapon's reticule gives you several pieces of critical information.\n\nThe first and foremost is that it shows you your Cone of Fire (CoF). As you fire your weapons, or take damage, or move rapidly, your CoF will expand. A large CoF is an inaccurate CoF, so you want to keep it as small as possible.\n\nTo understand how a CoF works, just imagine a cone that projects outward from your muzzle toward the horizon. The reticule outlines the current 'base' of that cone. So therefore, the wider that base is, the larger the potential impact area is as the bullets trace a line between your weapon's muzzle (the tip of the cone) and a random point somewhere on the base of the cone.\n\nAdditionally, when you hit a target with bullets, your reticule will 'pulse' letting you know that you've hit that target.\n\nLastly, the reticule shows you whether you're in-range of a target. If you center your reticule on a target, the reticule will turn more solid if the target is in range.
@HelpHUDShortcuts=Shortcuts
@HelpHUDShortcutsText=This shortcut bar is setup to allow you to easily activate/deactivate your implants, quickly use medkits, and to hang text macro icons once you create them.\n\nImplant and medkit shortcuts are created automatically when you have those items, but text macros have to be created manually.\n\nTo create a text macro, type /macro in your chat pane, followed by a three-letter descriptor tag, and then the actual chat command you want to execute.\n\nFor instance: /macro RAL /squad Retreat! Fall back to Squad Waypoint One!\n\nThe macro above would create a square icon with the letters "RAL" (short for RALLY) on it. You'd place that icon in your hotbar and then, when the appropriate F-key is pressed, the text macro will go off. In this case, the macro would result in a squad chat sentence saying "Retreat! Fall back to Squad Waypoint One!" and could be used to quickly order a retreat.

@HelpChatMacrosText=Voice macros are used as a quick substitute for extensive typing for commonly used phrases in the game.\n\nMost chat macros are mnemonic, meaning that the first letter of each step stands for what the option on the menu that starts with that letter.\n\nExample: VVA = Voice + Very Quick + Anytime! = Your character saying "Anytime!". Another example is VAM = Voice + Attack + Medical Terminal = Your character saying "Attack their Medical Terminal!".\n\nThe categories make quick sense if you spend a few moments investigating the sub-menus. A = Attack, D = Defense, R = Repair, and so on.\n\nThus, with just a few keystrokes, you can quickly whip off standard commands and acknowledgements.\n\nDon't forget that you can use text macros to supplement your voice macro menus. (See Shortcuts help for more info on text macros.)

########################################
#   BITCHIN' BETTY TEXT DESCRIPTIONS   #
########################################
# Bitchin' Betty Virtual Shooting Range
@betty_shooting_range_01=Welcome, soldier. You're currently in the Virtual Shooting Range, which is part of the overall Virtual Training System.\nBefore entering battle in the real world, you're encouraged to experiment with different equipment here. While in the Virtual Training System, all equipment is available to you - there are no certification restrictions. However, when you exit the Virtual Training System, the vast majority of equipment will be restricted again until you gain the needed experience and certifications.\nWhen you're ready to lay waste to the targets out there, go ahead and walk up to an Equipment Terminal and arm yourself. Finally, when you're ready to move on, simply walk into the exit portal in the center of the pavilion, which allows you to select your initial certification, and then move to the Virtual Driving Area. 
@betty_shooting_range_02=All right, let's get you licensed to use some starting equipment.\nRemember, in the Virtual Training System certifications are disabled, letting you try out everything. But when you're out on the real battlefield, you'll only be able to use equipment for which you have the required certification. Feel free to browse until you find one you like.\nLearn your chosen certification by clicking its name and hitting the "Learn" button at the bottom of the screen. If you accidentally choose the wrong certification, don't worry. Just select that certification name and click the "Unlearn" button to forget the certification and use the points again elsewhere. NOTE: There is no time penalty for unlearning a certification in the VR Training area, however, when you do this in the real world, there is a 24-hour "unlearning" period that must be passed before being able to spend your cert points elsewhere.\nAfter doing so, you can head into the Virtual Driving Area to test-drive some vehicles and then choose your starting vehicle certification. And if you want to try out some of the equipment a bit more before deciding, just close the certification menu to remain in the Shooting Range. 
@betty_driving_area_01=Vehicles are a faster, more convenient mode of transportation than your weary feet. They can also be powerful weapons of destruction on the battlefield. This Virtual Driving Area is available for you to try out each of the various vehicles available to our Empire.\nLike the Virtual Shooting Range, there are no certification restrictions within the Virtual Driving Area. To get your ride, walk up to any of the vehicle pads that are scattered across this small island and access a Vehicle Terminal.\nWhen you're ready to leave the VR Driving Area, just walk into an exit portal, which then lets you select your initial vehicle certification before leaving Virtual Reality.
@betty_driving_area_02=Welcome back to Certifications. This time, you're selecting a vehicle in which to certify. You must spend the two certification points provided here on at least one vehicle. If you've earned more certification points in the training areas, you can spend more, but you must spend at least two on a vehicle certification before you can leave.\nWhen choosing a certification, remember that while single person vehicles can be great at getting around, multi-personnel vehicles offer more protection and provide you with the ability to bring along extra squadmates.\nOnce you've selected your vehicle certification, you'll be able to continue in any of the available training programs, or exit to your Empire's Sanctuary.
@betty_combat_zone=When you're out in the real battlefield, unlike in the Virtual Shooting Range, your enemies are likely to shoot back - if not first! Don't worry. That's why the Virtual Combat Zone program was created.to allow you to square off against targets that will actively try to take you out.\nHowever, dying here is without consequence. There are three separate areas where you'll combat lightly-armed opponents all the way up to heavily-outfitted and armored enemies. The area you're currently facing is the least difficult area, whereas the area to the right of it is more dangerous, and the area at the other end of the Virtual Combat Zone is the most hazardous to your health.\nEquipment terminals are located at both at the entrance and the back of each area.\nWhen you're ready to suit up and head into the real battlefield - or if you want to switch to a different training program - walk into a nearby exit portal. 
@betty_sanctuary_tr=So you're ready to serve the Terran Republic.\nThis is your Empire's home Sanctuary. This 'home island' is a complete safe-haven from enemy activity. Here you'll only find other friendlies that belong to your Empire.\nThere's always strength in numbers, so don't be shy about looking to join a squad before venturing forth into the battlefield. And remember, you can return to the Virtual Training System whenever you want to polish your skills more.
@betty_sanctuary_nc=So you're ready to serve the New Conglomerate.\nThis is your Empire's home Sanctuary. This 'home island' is a complete safe-haven from enemy activity. Here you'll only find other friendlies that belong to your Empire.\nThere's always strength in numbers, so don't be shy about looking to join a squad before venturing forth into the battlefield. And remember, you can return to the Virtual Training System whenever you want to polish your skills more.
@betty_sanctuary_vs=So you're ready to serve the Vanu Sovereigncy.\nThis is your Empire's home Sanctuary. This 'home island' is a complete safe-haven from enemy activity. Here you'll only find other friendlies that belong to your Empire.\nThere's always strength in numbers, so don't be shy about looking to join a squad before venturing forth into the battlefield. And remember, you can return to the Virtual Training System whenever you want to polish your skills more.
@betty_equipment_01=All right, soldier, this is an Equipment Terminal - the most important terminal on the battlefield. The Equipment Terminal is where you obtain weapons, body armor, support devices, vehicular ammo, and this is where you manage your Favorites. Your current inventory is displayed to the right of the Equipment Terminal listing.
@betty_equipment_02=There are two ways to grab items from the equipment terminal. The first way is to left-click once on the graphical icon of the item, selecting it, then left-click on the Obtain button. The second way is to simply double-left click on the graphical item. As long as there's room within your personal inventory, the item will be automatically transferred into it.
@betty_equipment_03=You can also trash items from your personal inventory via the Recycle button - to do so, just left-click on an item. This turns the mouse cursor into the item. Then just left-click on the Recycle button, and the item will be removed.
@betty_equipment_04=The items available at the equipment terminal are divided into five separate tabs for your shopping convenience. Only equipment for which you possess certifications will be listed (unless you are in the Virtual Training areas, in which case all items are listed). Don't worry though, as you gain ranks and certifications, the list of available equipment will grow.
@betty_equipment_05a=The default tab that's flashing currently is the Weapons and Ammunition tab. Weapons are displayed as icons, directly followed by their respective ammo icons. As mentioned earlier, simply double left-click on an item's icon to obtain it.
@betty_equipment_05b=The next tab is the Body Armor tab, which allows you to change into different body armor types. As with other equipment, you must be certified in other body armor variants in order to see it on the list and obtain it. Body Armor varies in strength, as well as the number of holsters and available inventory space. Typically the stronger the armor, the slower the mobility speed.
@betty_equipment_05c=The middle tab is Support Equipment - here you can acquire default items such as medkits, and the invaluable remote electronics kit (REK).
@betty_equipment_05d=The Vehicle Ammo tab allows you to purchase vehicular ammo. Vehicles are fed ammo from their trunks, so to resupply a vehicle you just get the vehicular ammo, then place it directly into the vehicle's trunk.
@betty_equipment_06=The last tab is the Favorites tab, and it's well-named. Whereas the other tabs deal with obtaining individual pieces of equipment, the Favorites listing allows you to both save and recall fully loaded configurations. So essentially you can take a snapshot of your current inventory - body armor, weapons, and equipment - and save it to recall later at an Equipment Terminal.
@betty_equipment_07a=To save a favorite, left-click on an Empty Configuration slot. Then just left-click on the Save button underneath the list.
@betty_equipment_07b=You can name the favorite whatever you want for handy reference later. You can also overwrite existing favorites in the same manner. To load a saved favorite, you have two options available. The first method is to left-click once on the favorite, selecting it, then left-click on the Obtain favorite button.
@betty_equipment_07c=The other way is to double left-click on the favorite, which will replace your current configuration. You can delete a favorite by selecting it, then left-clicking on the Delete button.
@betty_equipment_07d=Last, but far from least, there are checkboxes next to each favorite. This is your Respawn Favorite. What this means is that if you die and respawn, you'll come back fully equipped with the selected Favorite.
@betty_equipment_08=All right, it's time to let you grab your gear. When you're done, either left-click on the X button at the upper right, or simply step away from the Equipment Terminal to exit the menu.
@betty_vehicle=This is a vehicle terminal where you can obtain vehicles.\nTo get a vehicle, you must first have the necessary certification. In the Virtual Driving Area, you can test drive any vehicles without certification restrictions. In the real battlefield, only vehicles that you possess certifications for will appear in the listing.\nTo acquire a vehicle, double-left click on the vehicle icon and it will be manufactured onto the pad in front of the vehicle terminal.\nAt that point you must enter the vehicle's driver position and drive it off the pad. If you don't remove the vehicle from the pad, it will be automatically deconstructed after a short time. Don't block traffic, soldier.
@betty_map_01=Okay, Soldier...this is the Map Pane. It shows you where you can go, how to get there, and what sort of threat you'll face once you arrive. In otherwords, it's your primary source of info on where the battles are and how to get to them.
@betty_map_02=You're looking at the global map view, which shows all Battle Continents where the Empires are waging war. The Sanctuaries are also shown here, which are the protected safe-havens for each of the Empires. Left-clicking once on a continent selects it and shows its warp gate connections, and also provides a local overview of friendly and enemy activity via the Continental Threat Indicator.  If you want to know how dangerous a continent currently is, then you definitely want to view the Continental Threat Indicator before jumping blindly into the battlefield. If the number is 1 or less, the danger is relatively low, but if it climbs to 2 or higher, then the continent has a high concentration of enemies. The color of the continent also lets you get an overview of the enemy activity on any continent - just as enemies that appear on your radar are red, the color red also designates a high continental danger factor. But your job isn't to avoid danger - it's to seek it. When you jump into hot zones, you'll be awarded more experience for earning ranks. So basically the more dangerous the continent, the higher the rewards for serving your Empire.
@betty_map_03=When zooming into the full continental display both the names of the facilities as well as facility types are displayed. Furthermore, you see which Empires own what facilities, based on the circular Spheres of Influence. Blue spheres represent the New Conglomerate, Red Spheres represent the Terran Republic, and Green Spheres represent the Vanu Sovereignty. The names of the continents that the warp gates connect are also shown next to each warp gate.
@betty_map_04=A number of tools are also available to you, allowing you to zoom in further as well as toggle different elements from the map display. Rolling the mouse pointer over buttons will give you a quick synopsis of what each button does. Remember, soldier, the map is your friend - it keeps you from getting lost, it shows you how to get around, and it points you to the action. Use it often.

#Bitchin' Betty First-Time Tips
@betty_tip_welcome=Welcome, soldier. You'll make a fine addition to the Empire. You're currently outside of the Main Base on our protected Sanctuary. Don't worry -- there's no combat here. Feel free to explore the Main Base and familiarize yourself with the area. Located nearby are vehicle stations, the Drop Facilities, and the main Sanctuary base itself. Farther afield are the gigantic warp gates that link this Sanctuary with the other continents of the world. As you look around, you'll encounter a number of objects that have floating icons above them that look like this. If you approach these icons you'll be given explanations as to what the objects they're next to do. You'll even earn a little experience in the process. Now go ahead and look around -- and don't forget you can return to the Virtual Reality Training Centers anytime to check out equipment, weapons or vehicles...and even earn a little experience.
@betty_tip_facility_orbital_shuttle=Welcome to the Drop Facility building. There are two Drop Facilities -- the other is located on the other side of the Main Base. These have HART shuttles regularly over-flying the various continents of the world.By choosing a drop destination on the drop zone interface (available on the HART shuttle) you can achieve orbital re-entry to any of the continents on Auraxis.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_training=The Virtual Training Center provides access to the Virtual Shooting Range, Virtual Driving Zone, and Virtual Combat. All three off these virtual zones allow you to freely try out equipment without certification restrictions.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_shooting=Welcome to the Virtual Shooting Range where you can test-fire any weapon against the various targets in the field. To obtain a weapon, simply walk up to an equipment terminal and press the action key. Note that all damage against friendlies is disabled.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_driving=Welcome to the Virtual Driving Zone where you can test-drive any vehicle on terrain encompassing varying levels of difficulty.
@betty_tip_facility_virtual_combat=Welcome to Virtual Combat where you can practice in a live-fire environment. The targets here will shoot at you, but there's no penalty to dying. To equip yourself, simply walk up to an equipment terminal and press the action key. Eliminating the targets will provide you with a small measure of Battle Experience Points, which are used for your primary rank advancement. Virtual Combat is only available through Battle Rank 6.
@betty_tip_pane_inventory=The Inventory Pane is where you manage the equipment you're carrying. On the left are holsters for weapons or equipment to equip-in-hand, and on the right is backpack space to store other items and ammunition. There are also four buttons: Use, Drop, Destroy, and Clear Inventory. Note that different body amor types have varying holster and backpack capacities.
@betty_tip_pane_character=The Character Pane displays your current Battle Rank and progress toward your next Battle Rank. Also shown are the Command Rank and progress toward its next rank. Grief Points record how much damage you've inflicted against other friendlies. Amassing Grief Points will result in punishment, but Grief Points also dissipate slowly to account for accidental friendly fire. Your current certifications are also listed, as well as any implants you ultimately obtain. You can also access your Personal Stats by pressing the Stats Button.
@betty_tip_pane_squad=The Squad Pane shows your current squad information, and assists you in finding other players to group, as well as managing your friends list.
@betty_tip_pane_map=The Map Screen has three different view levels. Global, which shows all continents and their warp gate links. Continental, which shows a full view of the selected continent and its corresponding threat indication. This view can be easily zoomed into by using the five pre-set zoom buttons at the bottom of the screen. Thus, you can easily move all the way down to a close tactical view of the area, as well as seeing a continental tactical view.
@betty_tip_pane_vehicle=The Vehicle Pane lets you control access settings for your present vehicle.
@betty_tip_pane_outfit=The Outfit Pane allows you access to your Outfit Information. You must belong to an Outfit before this button becomes active. To form an Outfit, a squad must have 10 members, none of which can already belong to an Outfit. The Squad Leader can then click on the Outfit Button and create an Outfit if everyone in the squad consents. From that point forward the Outfit button will provide access to Outfit Information for everyone within the Outfit.
@betty_tip_battle_rank_congrats=Congratulations, you have your earned Battle Rank 2. Each Battle Rank will award you further certification points to spend on other certifications, and other benefits as well.
@betty_tip_combat_rank_congrats=Congratulations, you have earned your first Command Rank. As you advance in Command Rank, you'll gain further access to special tactical commands.
@betty_tip_implant_congrats=Congratulations, you have earned your first Implant slot. Implants allow you to further specialize your character with such options as health regenerators, defense, and advanced targeting. To obtain an implant, go to an Implants Terminal. Additional implant slots will be awarded at higher Battle Ranks.
@betty_tip_warpgate_congrats=You have just entered the confines of a Warp Gate. To warp to the linked Battle Continent, proceed to the central warp core. Refer to your Global Map for the warp gate connections.

@OfflineTrainingFirstTimeMessage=For the purposes of training, you need to temporarily affiliate yourself with one of the three Empires. This is only for the training exercises. When you eventually log onto a server to play the game online, you'll make your real Empire choice then.

@Basic_01=Welcome, soldier. This is the first in a series of training exercises to get you primed for battle, so that you can maximize your potential in littering the battlefield with the bodies of those that oppose us. We'll be covering the Heads-Up Display, Movement, Identifying Friend and Foe, and Weapon Handling in this exercise. Also, to toggle this information pane on or off at any time, tap the F12 key. Before we go any further, let's go over your Heads-Up Display, or HUD for short. We'll start with the Chat pane.
@Basic_02=The Chat pane is split into two sections. The top part is where status messages appear – generally who killed who in the nearby vicinity, as well as other updates. The bottom part is where you can communicate with other friendly soldiers. The default channel is Local Chat, which broadcasts to anyone within a short proximity of your location. You'll find Chat to be very useful when coordinating with other friendlies.
@Basic_03=The Proximity Map displays up to a 200 meter radius. The arrow represents both your location and your heading. This will be detailed further in a later training exercise.
@Basic_04=The Status Bar provides you with access to the proximity map, along with your health, stamina, armor, hotkeys, holsters, and soldier management menu.
@Basic_05=The Proximity map button lets you toggle the Proximity map display on or off.	
@Basic_06=Your health, stamina, and armor are shown in these gauges. As you take damage, the health gauge will decrease – if it disappears completely, you'll be one with the dirt. You don't want that. Next is Stamina, which is depleted through jumping, incurring health damage, or using Implants. Lastly, armor is lost when absorbing damage from projectiles or explosive-based weaponry.
@Basic_07=These are your hotkeys, which are useful for aliasing items like medkits and implants for quick usage. This will be covered later.
@Basic_08=Next are your holsters, which show you what items you have ready to be equipped, as well as what number to press to equip the respective items. Right now you aren't carrying anything, so the holsters are empty.
@Basic_09=Last, but not least, you have the Soldier Management Menu button, which when pressed provides you with access to your Inventory, Character Info, Squad Info, Map View, Vehicle Access Settings, and Outfit Info.
@Basic_10=Now let's get you started with moving around; standing still is an open invitation to death from our enemies. Proceed to the next waypoint using the basic movement controls and the mouse to look around. If you want to adjust the Key Mappings or invert the free-look, simply access the Options menu and select Key Mappings at any time.
@Basic_11=Take a good look at these fellows, soldier. They belong to all three opposing Empires.Target the New Conglomerate soldier.
@Basic_12=This soldier belongs to the New Conglomerate. Their primary colors are blue and yellow. You'll see these colors on all of their body armor variants, as well as their vehicles. Next target the Terran Republic soldier.
@Basic_13=This soldier belongs to the Terran Republic. Their primary colors are red and black. You'll see these colors on all of their body armor variants, as well as their vehicles. Now target the Vanu Sovereignty soldier.
@Basic_14=This soldier belongs to the Vanu Sovereignty. Their primary colors are purple and green. You'll see these colors on all of their body armor variants, as well as their vehicles.
@Basic_15=The color of their name indicates whether they're friend or foe. Now if the name above a soldier or vehicle is red, then that's an enemy – there are no exceptions. If the name above the soldier or vehicle in your view is green, then it's a friendly. Likewise, if the soldier's name is white, it's a friendly that's a member within your squad.Now take a look at these soldiers – you'll note that one has his name in green, while the other two soldiers have their names in red. This is based on your original Empire selection you made prior to entering training. The soldier with the green name is a friendly belonging to the same Empire as yourself, whereas the other two belong to the opposing Empires. To help you better recognize friendlies and enemies in different body armor configurations, we'll go ahead and cycle through the common body armor that you'll encounter both friend and foe wearing in the battlefield.
@Basic_16=Your Proximity Map is also of great service when identifying friend from foe. Friendlies will always appear on your Proximity Map, whereas enemies will not. However, when you see the name of an enemy, it will appear on the Proximity Map as a red icon. Furthermore, if you're in a squad, this will be automatically shared to their Proximity Map as well.When you're ready, proceed to the next waypoint.
@Basic_17=In the distance you'll notice there are three soldiers. However, their names don't immediately appear. When soldiers are fairly close range, their names immediately appear when within your view. However, when soldiers exceed that range, you must target the soldier and their name will appear. Target all three of the soldiers in the distance to discover whether they're friend or foe.
@Basic_18=Good! Again, it's vital to recognize friend from foe. You don't want to end up gunning down a friendly! They won't appreciate it, and nor will your Empire. Just remember, if you see the name in red, it's definitely an enemy. Proceed to the next waypoint.
@Basic_19=Well, well, it looks like some careless soldier has dropped some equipment on the ground. This is a good opportunity to show you how to pick up equipment off the ground. Go up to all of the nearby items, target them at close range, then tap the Action key to pick up each item. You must pick up each item before being able to proceed.
@Basic_20=Let's see what Santa left you. You picked up a Suppressor, which is a trusty submachine gun, as well as a Beamer, which is a Vanu Sovereignty pistol. You also grabbed ammo for both. This is your lucky day! Now if you look at your holsters in the Status Bar, you'll now see two small icons representing the Suppressor and Beamer next to their respective Holster numbers. Directly underneath them is their ammunition. The number on the left represents how much ammo is in the gun, and the number on the right represents how much additional ammo is in the backpack. To equip an item that's in a Holster, just press the respective number. You can also holster the item in the same manner. Go ahead and equip the Suppressor.
@Basic_21=Feeling dangerous yet? Well, before you scratch that itch to pull that trigger, let's cover the holsters display a bit more. You'll first notice that the Suppressor's holster icon now has been highlighted, showing you that you've equipped it. To the left of the Suppressor icon is a small dot – this indicates the current firing mode. The Suppressor only has one firing mode, but many weapons and items have additional firing modes. For example, if you look at the Beamer, there are two dots next to it, indicating the Beamer has two firing mode. Lastly, between the ammunition is a colored icon – this shows you what type of ammunition you have in your weapon. Now head to the next waypoint to test out your new toy.
@Basic_22=Looks like we've got an enemy out there! Here's where you can practice using your Suppressor. A few notes before you begin. First, notice the circular reticule – this is your Cone of Fire – your shots will fall within this cone. However, it is adversely affected by moving, jumping, and firing a weapon in full auto. Running and gunning can prove to be very inaccurate beyond short range. Subsequently it's recommend to crouch or remain stationary as often as possible when firing a weapon to achieve maximum accuracy. Certain weapons also have extremely high recoil penalties, and when using these weapons it's best to fire in short, controlled bursts. Now go ahead and eliminate that enemy soldier. Remember to reload when necessary.
@Basic_23=Great job! Of course, keep in mind that real enemies will shoot back. But that's for later. Now earlier you picked up a couple ammo types for your Suppressor – standard 9mm bullets, which are what you're using now, and armor-piercing 9mm bullets. Standard 9mm bullets are best against soldiers, but notably weaker against vehicles. Armor-piercing 9mm bullets, on the other hand, are highly effective against enemy vehicles and other hard targets, but less effective against enemy soldiers. Let's show you the difference. There's a light assault buggy called the Harasser out there – send it to the junkyard! Fire off some of your current standard 9mm bullets into it and watch its health bar. Then swap ammunition to armor-piercing and shoot the Harasser some more – again, watch the health bar to see the difference. If you forget what ammo type is currently in the Suppressor at any point, remember to look at the color next to the ammo count. Now blow that Harasser to kingdom come! And be careful – you don't want to be standing near the Harasser when it explodes.
@Basic_24=So much for those wheels. Now, before we conclude this segment of the training, equip the Beamer pistol.
@Basic_25=This Beamer is part of the Vanu Sovereignty arsenal. Unlike many conventional weapons which have both standard ammunition and armor-piercing ammunition, the Vanu Sovereignty has both modes built into their weapons and you can toggle between them in different firing modes. However, the Beamer consumes twice as many units of energy when firing in armor-piercing mode versus standard mode.Now whereas with the Suppressor you swapped ammunition types, the Beamer will let you toggle between Firing Modes. Remember to reference the dots to the left of your Beamer holster to see your current firing mode. Now kill that enemy soldier using Standard Bolts, then destroy the Basilisk using Armor-Piercing Bolts.
@Basic_26=Excellent work! That concludes this exercise. If you want to get more target practice in before heading out into battle, be sure to visit the Virtual Shooting Range on your home Sanctuary. There you can experiment with a multitude of weapons in a safe environment.
@Basic_Ammo=You used up all your ammunition! For the purposes of this exercise, we'll automatically resupply you, but out in the real battlefield you might want to be a bit more conservative.
