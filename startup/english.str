@IAInstantActionToolTip=Select this button to transfer to a randomly selected hotspot.
@InstantActionSanctuaryDescription=This option takes you to your Empire's Sanctuary. Your Sanctuary is a safe haven where no combat is likely to occur. It houses the training facilities which allow you to spend more time with various weapons and vehicles, and also houses the Shuttle buildings which give you access to orbital drop pods.\n\nThe Sanctuary is the center of your Empire and your haven from harm. It's also an often-used staging ground from which to launch coordinated assaults.
@InstantActionHotSpotDescription=This option takes you to one of the many Hot Spots in the world so you can plunge immediately into action.\n\nA Hot Spot is anywhere where a sufficient quantity of your own Empire's troops are exchanging fire with enemy troops. This generally assures you of entering a good sized battle when choosing this option.\n\nWARNING! If you choose this option, you will be entering a live fire area and you will encounter hostiles.\n\nDon't worry though, if you need to leave, you can return to your Sanctuary by choosing the 'Return to Sanctuary' option in your ESCAPE menu.
@InstantActionDefaultDescription=Choose one of the two options on the left to determine where your new character appears within the world of Auraxis.\n\nPlace your cursor over one of the two buttons to get more information about that option.
@InstantActionNotInVehicle=You can't use instant action while in a vehicle.
@InstantActionNoHotspotsAvailable=There are no Hotspots on a non-locked continent (either through enemy action or through overpopulation). Instant Action will not function for you until one such destination exists.

@E2=New Conglomerate
@E3=Vanu Sovereignty
@Empire0=GENERAL BACKGROUND
@Empire1=TERRAN REPUBLIC
@Empire2=NEW CONGLOMERATE
@Empire3=VANU SOVEREIGNTY

@Empire0Description=In existence for over a thousand years, the Terran Republic was the sole governing power with an intergalactic reign. Largely militant in its rule, the Terran Republic nonetheless maintained absolute authority until recently when an expeditionary force was sent into a wormhole to colonize a newly discovered world named Auraxis.\n\nDuring the course of colonizing Auraxis, three Main Bases were established at different locations on the planet's surface to expedite the colonization. In the following years numerous outposts were constructed across Auraxis' continents.\n\nRemnants of an ancient alien race were also unearthed, and this race became known as the Ancient Vanu. No traces of what happened to the Ancients could ever be found, but elements of their technology were discovered during the colonization stages, most notably 'rebirthing' technology. Utilizing a hybrid of man-made and Vanu technology, humans were able to store their genetic pattern. Whenever someone died, the person would be able to come back to life via the rebirthing technology.\n\nNear the end of the colonization period, the wormhole collapsed, stranding the Terran Republic expedition from the main Empire. Tensions grew and escalated. Emboldened now that the main body of the Empire was cut off, the Terran Republic was ultimately divided into three Empires: those still allied with Terran Republic, and two new empires - the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nNow the three Empires are engaged in a world-wide war for control of Auraxis. A war without permanent death.
@Empire1Description=The Terran Republic's focus is to re-establish its authority as a single governing body. While the Terran Republic is actively engaged in an official state of war against those that seceded into the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty, the goal is to reunite everyone under the Terran Republic once again.\n\nThe traditionalists that comprise the Terran Empire are both embarrassed and outraged by the secessions, and strive to regain control as quickly as possible. This is partially to re-establish a single order, but also in fear of the wormhole re-opening and facing punitive measures for allowing the secessions to happen in the first place.\n\nTerran Republic equipment relies largely on speed, with an emphasis on fast-firing weaponry. Their weaponry lacks the punching power on an individual shot basis in comparison to the New Conglomerate, but they make up for it with an extremely fast refire rate.
@Empire2Description=The New Conglomerate was formed by soldiers who felt the Terran Republic was too militant and outdated in its governing practices. While many felt oppressed, the sheer size of the Terran Republic Empire was a silencing factor. Once the wormhole collapsed, though, many soldiers began openly questioning and criticizing the Republic's ways, and soon a violent revolution occurred in which the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty formed.\n\nIn direct oppostion to the Terran Republic's rigid government, the New Conglomerate envisions a free society. Their soldiers combat the Terran Republic to resist becoming reacquired, and the Vanu Sovereignty who wish to monopolize the alien technology.\n\nThe New Conglomerate focus on hitting as hard as possible. While they lack the rapid fire of Terran Republic weapons and the adaptability of Vanu Sovereignty arms, their weapons are the most powerful on a per-shot basis.
@Empire3Description=The Vanu Sovereignty was formed at the same time the New Conglomerate seceded from the Terran Republic. Unlike the New Conglomerate, which simply desires more freedom, and the Terran Republic, which fights to regain control, the Vanu Sovereignty seeks to master the alien Vanu technology found on Auraxis.\n\nThe Vanu Sovereignty believes that the collapse of the wormhole was a blessing, allowing them to form their own Empire dedicated to unearthing and utilizing Vanu technology. They view the Terran Republic with open disdain, and don't trust the New Conglomerate's 'free society'. Ultimately, they feel that they alone understand the true potential of the Vanu technology, and must combat the other empires to preserve and control all discoveries.\n\nUnlike the New Conglomerate and Terran Republic, which have more traditional arms, the Vanu Sovereignty has 'interpreted' Vanu science to create exotic energy-based weapons and hover vehicles.

# Equipment Terminal Descriptions
#---------------------------------------------------------
# WEAPONS
# <standard assault>
@ilc9_info=The AMP is designed for close-range combat. It is the only rapid-fire pistol and can empty a full clip extremely quickly. However, it suffers from  poor recoil, causing it to be very inaccurate when fired beyond a close range.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@repeater_info=The primary sidearm for the Terran Republic is the Repeater pistol. As with all Terran Republic technology, the Repeater's design focuses on a swift firing rate and good ammo base. What the Repeater lacks in power it makes up with these attributes.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@suppressor_info=An effective, light-weight, and compact submachine gun, the Suppressor is a solid close-quarters weapon. And with its low recoil, it's easy to aim and utilize in combat.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@isp_info=Essentially a handheld shotgun pistol, the Scatter Pistol is primarily designed for close quarter combat. Due to its short barrel design, the Scatter Pistol isn't very effective beyond close range.\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@beamer_info=The Beamer is the primary sidearm of Vanu Sovereignty soldiers. It is a high power/short range energy weapon, capable of inflicting notable damage on enemy soldiers. The primary drawback the Beamer suffers from is degradation of the beam's power over range, resulting in weaker hits at long distances.\nAmmo: Energy cell.
@anniversary_gun_info=The Spear is the New Conglomerate's 10mm pistol.  It is capable of firing over a large distance but has a slow rate of fire and high damage degradation.  Works best against infantry.\nAmmo: 10mm Multi-Phase
@anniversary_guna_info=The Stinger is the Terran Republic's 10mm pistol.  It is capable of firing over a large distance but has a slow rate of fire and high damage degradation.  Works best against infantry.\nAmmo: 10mm Multi-Phase
@anniversary_gunb_info=The Eraser is the Vanu Sovereignty's 10mm pistol.  It is capable of firing over a large distance but has a slow rate of fire and high damage degradation.  Works best against infantry.\nAmmo: 10mm Multi-Phase

# <medium assault>
@cycler_info=The Cycler is the fastest firing assault rifle. It is also equipped with an enhanced magnification of four times, allowing it to effectively target distant enemies. It uses a cylinder drum for its ammunition source.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@flechette_info=Built on standard shotgun technology, the Sweeper fires a burst of slugs which are very effective against infantry and other "soft" targets. It is not particularly useful against vehicles or other well armored targets.\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@punisher_info=The Punisher is a well-rounded assault rifle that incorporates not just a standard automatic firing mode, but comes equipped with a launcher that is capable of firing either rocklets or grenades. Its standard firing mode delivers reliable short to medium range combat capability.\nWhile it can effectively reach long range, its limited zooming makes aiming effectively somewhat of a hindrance.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).\nSecondary mode uses either rocklets, fragmentation grenades, plasma grenades, or jammer grenades.
@gauss_info=Using magnetic field technology, the Gauss assault rifle combines standard combustion-based ammunition with a magnetic field that boosts the actual projectile speed when fired. This allows the Gauss to use standard ammunition more effectively than other assault rifles.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@pulsar_info=The Pulsar automatic assault rifle is a highly effective weapon utilized by the Vanu Sovereignty. With minimum recoil due to its energy-based technology, the Pulsar can be devastating at short to medium range.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <sniper>
@bolt_driver_info=The Bolt Driver is a powerful sniper rifle and is capable of killing lightly armored enemy soldiers in a single shot. It suffers from only being able to load a single bolt at a time, thus requiring reloading after every shot.\nAmmo: Bolt.
@heavy_sniper_info=The Heavy Scout Rifle is less powerful than the Bolt Driver, but has a ten-shot clip and can refire much faster.\nAmmo: Bolt.

# <heavy assault>
@mini_chaingun_info=The Mini Chaingun is a heavy assault machine gun that is designed to rapidly spit out rounds from a generous ammo base. While not particularly damaging per shot, the sheer speed at which it fires can easily rip apart an enemy soldier.\nAmmo: 9mm bullet (standard or AP).
@r_shotgun_info=The Jackhammer is a heavy assault shotgun with a powerful secondary fire mode.\n\nWhen firing in secondary mode, all three barrels are fired in rapid succession, faster than would occur if you pulled the trigger normally. This results in incredible carnage in a short period of time.\n\nAmmo: Shotgun shell (standard or AP).
@lasher_info=The Lasher fires a special concentrated energy 'orb' that lashes out against any soldiers or vehicles at close range as it moves past them. The damage it delivers is variable, based on whether it actually hits a target or simply lashes it. A target that is lashed may receive several minor damage hits, while a target that is directly impacted by the orb receives a single large impact.\nAmmo: Energy cell.

# <anti-vehicular>
@hunterseeker_info=The Phoenix uses wire-guided technology to allow the operator to literally fly the missile into the intended target. As soon as the missile is fired, the operator switches to a camera mounted on the tip of the warhead. While the missile is in flight, the operator can either directly fly the missile to impact, or press the primary fire key anytime during flight to detonate the warhead immediately (in case of a near miss).\nAmmo: Phoenix missile.
@striker_info=The Striker serves as the Terran Republic's main anti-vehicular missile launcher. When in primary firing mode, the Striker will attempt to lock-on to an armored target (heavy assault suit, vehicle, or turret) as long as the reticule is kept on the target for a short duration. Once lock-on is achieved, a lock-on confirmation is displayed, along with a confirmation tone. At this point tapping the primary fire key will launch the missile and it will home in on the respective target. In secondary firing mode, it launches a dumbfire missile where it's aimed.\nAmmo: Striker missile.
@lancer_info=The Lancer is a shoulder-mounted beam weapon that the Vanu Sovereignty utilize in combating enemy vehicles. It is specifically designed to inflict high damage versus armored targets.\nAmmo: Lancer cartridge.

# <special assault>
@rocklet_info=The Rocklet Rifle carries a small payload of rocklets which are effective up to medium range. Each rocklet delivers a reasonably powerful explosive force. It possesses no guidance capabilities making it a dumbfire projectile. When in secondary mode, pressing the trigger launches all rocklets in rapid succession, emptying the weapon of any remaining rocklets.\nAnti Air: The Rocklet can also make use of Fragmentation Grenade Packs to fire anti air flak projectiles. While not as effective as using a dedicated anti vehicle or anti air weapon, this use can be helpful in assaulting enemy air units hovering nearby.\nAmmo: Rocket pod and Fragmentation Grenade Packs.
@thumper_info=A standard grenade launcher, the Thumper can lob grenades to a medium range and can be used for indirect fire.\nAmmo: Fragmentation, jammer, or plasma Grenade Packs.
@phoenix_info=The Decimator is an extremely powerful missile launcher utilizing a disposable design; once all three of its pre-loaded shots are fired, the Decimator launcher is useless and discarded. In standard mode, the Decimator is a dumbfire missile launcher.\n\nIf you want to get a closer view of your target, you can also fire this weapon in a secondary firing mode that allows a dumb-fire projectile with you attached in camera view. Use this tactically to spy out a remote position.\n\nAmmo: Built-in (fire and forget after three shots)

# <elite assault>
@oicw_info=The Scorpion is a missile launcher that uses range-finder technology to fire 'smart' missiles from a long range.\nEach missile flies a user-determined distance where it will then detonate (dealing a small amount of damage) and unleash several smaller explosives in a downward direction.\nAmmo: Scorpion Missile
@flamethrower_info=The powerful Dragon is a type of flamethrower that makes use of Incendiary Gel to burn living objects.\nAt a close range you can stream fire onto nearby soldiers, or release a Sunburst fireball that deals heavy area damage.\nAmmo: Incendiary Gel

# <melee>
@chainblade_info=The Chainblade is the standard combat knife of the Terran Republic. Its primary attack is a silent slash that is good for dispatching wounded foes. The secondary attack activates the blade's cutting chain, which does grievous damage but is very loud.
@forceblade_info=The Forceblade is the standard combat knife of the Vanu Sovereignty. Its primary attack is a silent slash, good for stealthily dispatching wounded foes. The secondary attack activates an energy field around the blade that dramatically increases its cutting ability, but causes a loud hum that attracts attention.
@magcutter_info=The MAG-Cutter is the standard combat knife of the New Conglomerate. Its primary attack is a silent slash, good for stealthily dispatching wounded foes. The secondary attack activates a magnetic vibrating field around the blade, dramatically increasing its cutting ability, but causing a distinctive hum that is quite loud.
@katana_info=The Fusion Blade can be used as an alternative to the standard knife. Its primary attack is a weak but silent slash. Its secondary attack creates an energy field around the blade that nullifies air resistance, allowing the sword to be swung much faster, but causes a loud hum as well.

# <Core Combat>
@maelstrom_info=The Maelstrom fires a Vortex Whip, a beam that causes constant damage to whatever it contacts.\n\nThe secondary fire mode is a Chain-Lash grenade, which explodes on impact and lashes other objects in the area, causing additional damage in similar fashion as the VS Lasher.\n\nThe weapon is powered by an energy capacitor, which can powered through proximity to either Energy Crystals (within the caverns) or the repair silo at a facility with the Equipment Module installed.
@radiator_info=The Radiator is an Ancient-Tech (AT) weapon powered by an energy capacitor. There are three ways to repower this capacitor. You can either acquire AT Recharge Canisters from an equipment terminal (as you would with ammo in a human weapon) or you can power the weapon through proximity to an AT device. Those devices are either Energy Crystals (within the caverns) or you can stand near a repair silo at a facility that has the Equipment Module installed.\n\nThe primary fire mode of the Radiator launches a small grenade that detonates in a moderate-sized explosion. However, the explosion itself causes no damage.\n\nInstead, the area affected becomes irradiated for a short period of time. Any objects within that area, or any objects passing through that area while the area is irradiated, will take damage over time.\n\nObviously, the weapon has a great number of tactical opportunities other than straight damage.
@spiker_info=The Spiker is an Ancient-Tech (AT) weapon powered by an energy capacitor. There are three ways to repower this capacitor. You can either acquire AT Recharge Canisters from an equipment terminal (as you would with ammo in a human weapon) or you can power the weapon through proximity to an AT device. Those devices are either Energy Crystals (within the caverns) or you can stand near a repair silo at a facility that has the Equipment Module installed.\n\nThe pistol is a Medium Assault weapon and does comparable damage, but only fits in a pistol slot. Thus it is very popular with the lighter armors.\n\nAdditionally, the Spiker shot can be either fired immediately (by merely tapping the left-mouse button) or charged for greater damage (by pressing the left-mouse button until max charge is reached and then releasing that mouse button to fire the weapon).\n\nNOTE: The Spiker energy charge drops back to zero if not fired at the moment when it reaches its peak. Thus, this weapon requires a certain element of skill to time the shots for absolute maximum damage.

# AMMUNITION
#---------------------------------------------------------
@WeaponAmmunitionType=Ammunition Type: %1

# <hand-held ammo>
@9mmbullet_info=The standard bullet used in most projectile weapons, this ammunition is best against 'soft' targets.
@9mmbullet_AP_info=This armor-piercing ammunition penetrates the heavier armor of vehicles, MAXs, and equipment such as terminals, generators, and deployables.
@shotgun_shell_info=The standard shell for all shotgun-based weapons, this cartridge is best used against 'soft' targets.
@shotgun_shell_AP_info=This armor-piercing shotgun slug penetrates the heavier armor of vehicles, MAXs, and equipment such as terminals, generators, and deployables.

# <vehicle ammo>
@105mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 100 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the 100 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFProwler\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe 100 mm Cannon lacks the power of the 150 mm Cannon, but enjoys a faster refire rate and moderate recoil penalties.
@12mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 12 mm Rotary Chaingun.\nThe following vehicles use the 12 mm Rotary Chaingun:\n\\#00FFFFBasilisk, Harasser, Juggernaut, Leviathan, Lightning, Marauder, Mosquito, Skyguard, Vindicator\n\n\\#FFFFFFDesigned primarily as an anti-infantry weapon, the Rotary Chaingun is a high-speed machine gun capable of projecting rounds at an extremely fast rate. While each round itself does little damage, the refire rate more than compensates, and the Rotary Chaingun is capable of delivering damage through aggregate means. The Rotary Chaingun does suffer from recoil, however, and firing in full automatic mode can easily reduce accuracy - it's ideally suited for firing in bursts at close to medium range.
@150mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 150 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the 150 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFVanguard\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe most powerful anti-vehicular cannon on a per shot basis, the 150 mm Cannon combines devastating power, proximity damage, and long range capabilities to make it an ideal anti-tank weapon. The 150 mm does suffer from a poor refire rate, but is nonetheless the king of vehicular cannons.
@15mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 15mm Chaingun.\nThe following vehicles use the 15mm Chaingun:\n\\#00FFFFJuggernaut, Prowler, Raider\n\n\\#FFFFFFWhile the 12mm Chaingun is better against infantry, and the 20mm Recoilless Chaingun is better against vehicles, the 15mm is good against everything and makes for an incredibly versatile weapon in almost all combat situations.
@20mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon.\nThe following vehicles use the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFDeliverer, Galaxy, Reaver, Vanguard, Vindicator\n\n\\#FFFFFFWhile the 20 mm Recoilless Cannon doesn't have the blazing refire rate found on other machine gun class weapons such as the Rotary Chaingun, it nonetheless makes up with increased damage per shot and improved accuracy. The 20 mm Recoilless Cannon can be used effectively against infantry as well as lightly armored vehicles even over long range.
@25mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the Liberator and Vulture's tailgun.
@35mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 35mm Chaingun.\n\nThe following vehicles use the 35mm Chaingun:\n\\#00FFFFGalaxy Gunship, Liberator, Vulture\n\n\\#FFFFFFEffective against vehicles but best suited towards aircraft and infantry.
@75mmbullet_info=Ammunition for the 75 mm Cannon.\nThe following vehicles use the 75 mm Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFJuggernaut, Leviathan, Lightning, Vindicator\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe 75 mm Cannon launches explosive shells that inflict heavy damage against vehicles and moderate damage against infantry. A reasonable refire rate gives the 75 mm a somewhat balanced role as both anti-vehicular and anti-infantry. Each shell is explosive and damages a small area effect.
@pulse_particle_accelerator_info=Ammunition for the Pulse Particle Accelerator.\nThe following vehicle uses the Pulse Particle Accelerator:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially an automatic laser machine gun. The individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic. The pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they dissipate. As with the Rotary Chaingun and 20 mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@pulse_battery_info=Ammunition for the Pulse Particle Accelerator.\nThe following vehicle uses the Pulse Particle Accelerator:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFDispersing energy pulses at a fairly quick rate, the Pulse Particle Accelerator (PPA) is essentially an automatic laser machine gun. The individual shots themselves don't inflict much damage, but the PPA benefits from extremely low recoil effects when being fired in full automatic. The pulses themselves also retain their full charge at up to medium range at which point they dissipate. As with the Rotary Chaingun and 20 mm Recoilless Cannon, the PPA is well suited as an anti-infantry weapon.
@proximity_mine_info=The Proximity Mine is extremely powerful, designed primarily as an anti-vehicular weapon.
@groundpounder_info=Ammunition for the GroundPounder Shaped Mortar Launcher.\nThe following vehicles use the GroundPounder:\n\\#00FFFFGalaxy Gunship, Marauder\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe GroundPounder inflicts much of its damage through near-proximity radius. When fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases rapidly to the proximity's edge. Due to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@heavy_grenade_mortar_info=Ammunition for the GroundPounder Heavy Grenade Launcher.\nThe following vehicles use the GroundPounder:\n\\#00FFFFGalaxy Gunship, Marauder\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe GroundPounder inflicts much of its damage through near-proximity radius. When fired, the GroundPounder launches small mortars that arc into the ground, inflicting high damage at the epicenter. The damage decreases rapidly to the proximity's edge. Due to its arc, the GroundPounder's accuracy reduces over great ranges.
@fluxcannon_info=Ammunition for the Flux Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the Flux Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFThresher\n\n\\#FFFFFFConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies. While an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75 mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate. When fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@flux_cannon_thresher_battery_info=Ammunition for the Flux Cannon.\nThe following vehicles use the Flux Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFLeviathan, Thresher\n\n\\#FFFFFFConcentrated orbs of energy are how the Flux Cannon delivers damage against enemies. While an individual orb doesn't inflict the same damage as a 75 mm Cannon, the Flux Cannon enjoys a slightly faster refiring rate. When fired, the orbs also travel at a fast rate, but can often be avoided at long range by perceptive opponents.
@liberator_bomb_info=Ammunition for the Liberator and Vulture's bomb bay.
@railbeam_info=Ammunition for the Rail Beam.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rail Beam:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFExtremely precise and powerful, the Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects. The Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@heavy_rail_beam_battery_info=Ammunition for the Rail Beam.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rail Beam:\n\\#00FFFFMagrider\n\n\\#FFFFFFExtremely precise and powerful, the Rail Beam is specifically designed to destroy enemy vehicles and objects. The Rail Beam suffers from a poor refire rate as it recharges between shots, and is very difficult to utilize against infantry. But with a minimal recoil and long range capability, the Rail Beam is an effective weapon against even heavily armored enemies.
@firebird_missile_info=Ammunition for the Firebird Rocket Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Firebird Rocket Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFEnforcer\n\n\\#FFFFFFLaunching potent rockets at a fairly rapid rate, the Firebird is extremely useful when mounted on mobile armor.\n\nThe refire rate is average, but each rocket delivers both solid damage and a reasonable proximity effect when exploding.\n\nThe projectiles travel at a fairly swift rate when launched, but are best used against close- to medium-range vehicular targets. Targets at longer ranges can generally undertake evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit by a Firebird rocket.
@reaver_rocket_info=Ammunition for the Rocket Pod Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Rocket Pod Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFReaver\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe Rocket Pod Launcher swiftly dispenses a solid payload of small dumbfire rockets. Due to the dumbfire nature of the rockets, it's most effectively used at close range, where both soldiers and vehicles alike can become victims of direct hits or the collective splash damage.
@skyguard_flak_cannon_ammo_info=Ammunition for the Flak Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the Flak Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFSkyguard\n\n\\#FFFFFFA very effective weapon against aircraft.
@gauss_cannon_ammo_info=Ammunition for the Gauss Cannon.\nThe following vehicle uses the Gauss Cannon:\n\\#00FFFFThunderer\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe Gauss Cannon propels a solid projectile down a magnetic tube, increasing in speed every few centimeters, until it comes hurtling out the end of the cannon at a lethal velocity.\n\nThe Gauss Cannon uses the vehicle's engine supply to power up this high-energy weapon. The rounds tend to fragment and explode upon impact due to the shell's construction. This is done to make them somewhat useful against infantry targets, but the weapon is predominantly designed for anti-armor work.
@fluxpod_ammo_info=Ammunition for the Flux Pod Launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Flux Pod Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFAurora\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe Aurora's Flux Pod Launcher is designed to provide dismounted infantry with support fire against ground targets after they've been delivered to target.\n\nThe Flux Pods are launched indirectly, much like regular rockets, and can be fired individually or in salvos for greater destruction and suppression.
@hellfire_ammo_info=Ammunition for the Hellfire rocket launcher.\nThe following vehicle uses the Hellfire Rocket Launcher:\n\\#00FFFFFury\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe Hellfire rocket is slow, but powerful. Used effectively, it can destroy even heavily armored targets. The Hellfire has a clip of two shots so 'bracketing patterns' can be launched at a single target as the Fury hurtles across the ground. However, the long reload times between each salvo of two shots, requires the Fury driver to fade away and circle for another shot before attacking again.
@wasp_gun_ammo_info=Ammunition for the Swarm 12mm Chaingun.\nThe following vehicle uses the Swarm 12mm Chaingun:\n\\#00FFFFWasp\n\n\\#FFFFFFThe Swarm chaingun fires rapid bursts of 12mm explosive bullets.  These rounds are highly damaging to aircraft, but are less effective against other targets.
@wasp_rocket_ammo_info=Ammunition for the Wasp Missile System.\nThe following vehicle uses the Wasp Missile System:\n\\#00FFFFWasp\n\n\\#FFFFFFWasp missiles are fast, powerful, and able to seek targets once lock-on is acheived.  A two-missile salvo will destroy enemy Wasps, and do severe damage to other airborne threats.

# ARMOR TYPES
@standard_issue_armor_info=This is the armor you respawn in after dying. It has very little protection, can carry a pistol and a rifle, and has a small inventory space. It's best to avoid using this armor whenever possible, since everyone on Auraxis can also use Agile Armor, which is superior. However, you'll need to get Agile Armor from a nearby Equipment Terminal.
@lite_armor_info=With about twice the armor of Standard, and the flexibility of a second pistol slot and larger inventory, the Agile Armor is a vast improvement over Standard. You still maintain good footspeed and this is the heaviest armor you can wear and still pilot/drive all vehicles.
@med_armor_info=This is the heaviest non-MAX armor out there. With two pistol slots, two rifle slots, and a large inventory space, this armor is great stuff. However, the bulk of the armor reduces your footspeed and is a significant trade-off.
@stealth_armor_info=While this is not technically armor, the "stealth suit" allows you to cloak yourself on the battlefield to avoid visual detection. It provides NO armor protection and has very little inventory space, and only a single pistol slot, but is extremely useful anyway.
@trhev_antiaircraft_info=This Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) uses twin Bursters to throw 'flak' projectiles into the sky and is designed to destroy enemy aircraft. The rate of fire when Anchored makes these weapons especially formidable.
@trhev_antipersonnel_info=Using the Dual-Cyclers mounted on its arms, this anti-infantry configuration of the MAX (Mechanized Assault eXo-suit) can unleash great volumes of lead in any direction, especially when Anchored.
@trhev_antivehicular_info=The arm-mounted Pounders on this MAX propel high velocity mortar rounds that act, in effect, like mini-tank shells, causing impressive damage against vehicles and MAX units, as well as building equipment.
@nchev_antiaircraft_info=This MAX uses the Sparrow Missile Launcher to track and destroy enemy aircraft.
@nchev_antipersonnel_info=The heavy assault Scattercannon is typically used by this MAX to destroy enemy personnel and cause collateral damage.
@nchev_antivehicular_info=The dumbfire Falcon used by this Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) can punch through the heaviest of armor and is used widely to destroy enemy ground vehicles.
@vshev_antiaircraft_info=This MAX uses the Starfire weapon to home in and destroy enemy aircraft.
@vshev_antipersonnel_info=This nimble MAX uses the Quasar rifle to destroy enemy personnel and create collateral damage.
@vshev_antivehicular_info=The Comet anti-armor weaponry is used by this Mechanized Assault eXo-suit (MAX) to destroy enemy armor and ground targets.

# MISC EQUIPMENT
@ace_info=The ACE uses nano-tech to create matrix patterns in one of four varieties. Used by Combat Engineers exclusively, the ACE can be deployed as either a High-Explosive Mine, a remote-detonated Boomer, a deployable Spitfire turret, or a deployable Motion Sensor Alarm. 
@advanced_ace_info=The FDU is used by combat engineering specialists to create larger deployables on the battlefield than could be generated with an ACE.  Depending on the engineer's qualifications, the FDU can be deployed to construct a TRAP, a deployable field turret, or an Aegis Shield Generator.
@bank_info=The Body Armor Nano Kit, or BANK, is designed to repair damaged body armor. The BANK requires an Engineering certification in order to utilize its functionality. The BANK uses an Armor Canister as fuel to repair Body Armor - when the Armor Canister is depleted, the soldier can load another Armor Canister (if carried).
@command_detonater_info=This uplink device is only available to Rank 2 Commanders and above.\n\nThis mechanism is used to communicate with automatic systems high above Auraxis in the Orbital Station.\n\nMost timed command abilities require the equipping of this item before they will function.
@flail_targeting_laser_info=This laze pointer is used to generate targets of interest for your squadmates. By using this device, you can create a temporary waypoint that your entire squad/platoon can see for a brief duration.\n\nThis laze pointer is also highly useful as a tool for forward observers to use in designating targets for Liberators or Flails.
@frag_grenade_info=Fragmentation grenades skewer their blast radius with shrapnel when exploding. Soldiers are particularly vulnerable to fragmentation grenades, as the shrapnel can easily pierce body armor. The closer the soldier is to the fragmentation grenade when it explodes, the higher the damage quotient (due to the increased chance of being hit by shrapnel). It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.
@jammer_grenade_info=Designed specifically to interfere with electrical systems, the Jammer grenade doesn't impart any physical damage, but plays havoc with a myriad of electrical equipment. Any electrical equipment caught within a Jammer grenade's blast will be affected. The effects of the Jammer grenade are also proximity-based; the closer electrical equipment is to the epicenter, the longer the jamming effect. It can be thrown to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.\nJammers can disrupt the function of turrets and motion sensors, as well as safely detonating all mines in the area. They also reset the implant timers on all soldiers in the area.
@medkit_info=The standard Medkit restores health points to a soldier. This can be done quickly, in the field, when injured and in an urgent situation.\n\nNOTE: A hotkey is automatically created on your hotbar the first time you put a medkit in your inventory. To use that medkit, simply tap the appropriate F-key to activate it.
@medicalapplicator_info=This is a multi-purpose medical tool that can be administered to yourself or other friendly soldiers. It consumes standard Health canisters when used.
@mine_sweeper_info=The Mine Sweeper is a small electrical device that emits a specialized magnetic field that will trigger and instantly destroy any enemy mines within its radius. The Mine Sweeper is actually treated like a grenade in usage - the player literally throws it into an area at which point it explodes, destroying any enemy mines within its radius.
@nano_dispenser_info=The NanoDispenser is a large repair device that can repair any damaged object or vehicle. The dispenser requires Engineering certification in order to use, and uses Armor Canisters for fuel.
@plasma_grenade_info=The Plasma grenade contains highly-compressed plasma which burns any unfortunate soldiers, objects, or vehicles caught in it's explosion radius. It can be set to detonate either on impact, or with a three-second fuse.
@remote_electronics_kit_info=The Remote Electronics Kit (REK) is a hand-held hacking device that interfaces with enemy terminals at close range. Most REK functions require either Hacking or Advanced Hacking certifications, but there are also standard functions that don't require any hacking certifications such as hacking enemy door IFFs and control consoles.\n\nSoldiers with a Hacking certification can hack some of the basic enemy terminals for use by friendly troops, including implant terminals, medical terminals, certification terminals, and lockers. They also hack doors and control consoles faster than soldiers without a Hacking certification and can 'jack' vehicles, switching them to your own Empire.\n\nAn Advanced Hacker does everything a Hacker can do, but does it at very fast speeds, thus minimizing risk to the hacker. They are also able to temporarily hack enemy Equipment and Vehicle terminals (in addition to those listed for basic Hacking) so that other friendlies can use them, as well as 'jack' vehicles at an even faster speed than regular Hackers.
@trek_info=The T-REK is modified Remote Electronics Kit with the ability to upload viruses into a base's Main Terminal, enemy vehicles, and certain Combat Engineering deployables.  It can also shoot a concentrated beam of viral data into a vehicle at long range, decreasing speed and handling for a short time.
@super_armorkit_info=An additional reward to players who found all the sleds and xmas trees during the holiday event.  This experimental repair kit makes use of nanite technology to enable soldiers without an engineering certification to quickly repair up to 200 points of their own armor.  However, this prototype has the problem of creating a temporary instability in the armor: using more than one during this 20 minute period would cause any armor to disintegrate.
@super_medkit_info=An additional reward to players who found all the snowmen during the holiday event.  This suped-up version of the standard Medkit restores 100 points of health, but is only safe to use once every 20 minutes.
@super_staminakit_info=An additional reward to players who found all the gingerbread men during the holiday event.  This item can be used to give soldiers a boost to their adrenaline, effectively restoring 100 stamina points.  However, it is ineffective to use more than one in a 20 minute period.

The secondary fire mode tightens the spread of the slugs for better effect at distance, but does so at the loss of number of slugs and refire rate.
@peregrine_mechhammer_left=Hammer
@peregrine_mechhammer_right=Hammer
@peregrine_particle_cannon=Particle Cannon
@peregrine_particle_cannon_info=The Particle Cannon converts mass into plasmoid energy and pushes it up to relativistic speeds. This sucker punches hard and leaves a minor irradiation field at the location that it hits, eating away at armor.

#
# All vehicle names should include a plural token. The plural
# token is indicated by appending an s to the vehicle name,
# e.g. the plural token of @dropship is @dropships

@two_man_assault_buggy=Harasser
@two_man_assault_buggyd=Destroyed Harasser
@two_man_assault_buggyinfo=The Harasser has room for a driver and a gunner. Both people sit in an open-air compartment that affords little protection, but lightens the vehicle to increase its speed. The passenger position has a mounted 12mm Rotary Chaingun that can be used to "ride shotgun" in an anti-infantry role. 
@two_man_assault_buggy_destroyed=Your Harasser has been destroyed.

@twomanhoverbuggy=Thresher
@twomanhoverbuggyd=Destroyed Thresher
@twomanhoverbuggyinfo=The Vanu Sovereignty's version of a Heavy Buggy is built upon a gravitic drive system that replaces the usual wheels with 4 anti grav pods that propel the buggy. It sports a Flux Cannon that serves as the primary weapon. Though the Vanu Sovereignty's version of an Assault Buggy may not be as armored or feature the wide firing arcs that other Empires have, its hover capabilities allow it to effectively strafe left or right thus offsetting some of its other disadvantages with increased maneuverability. In addition, this hover capability allows the Vanu Sovereignty hover buggy to sustain travel over water for short periods of time, allowing it to easily ford small rivers and ponds.
@twomanhoverbuggy_destroyed=Your Thresher has been destroyed.

@twomanheavybuggy=Enforcer
@twomanheavybuggyd=Destroyed Enforcer
@twomanheavybuggyinfo=The New Conglomerate's version of a heavy buggy sports an Advanced Rocket Launcher mounted in an open 360-degree turret.\n\nThe ARL (aka Firebird) is a single barreled rocket launcher that automatically reloads after firing providing extra rockets are available in the 'trunk space' of the vehicle.
@twomanheavybuggy_destroyed=Your Enforcer has been destroyed.

@threemanheavybuggy=Marauder
@threemanheavybuggyd=Destroyed Marauder
@threemanheavybuggyinfo=The Marauder heavy buggy sports more armor protection, fire power, and passengers than the buggies of other Empires. The primary weapon system consists of a 360-degree capable heavy proximity grenade launcher (Ground Pounder). The Grenade Launcher is a relatively short barreled weapon that can fire off several rounds before needing to reload. The secondary weapon system is a 12 mm Rotary Chaingun mounted to the right of the driver. 
@threemanheavybuggy_destroyed=Your Marauder has been destroyed.

@quadassault=Basilisk
@quadassaultd=Destroyed Basilisk
@quadassaultinfo=The four-wheeled ATV Assault Quad is the most agile attack vehicle, combining reasonably potent offensive capabilities and speed. The primary weakness of the Assault Quad is its light armor that allows the vehicle its superior handling.\n\nThe General Assault Quad has Light Rotary Chainguns mounted side-by-side in front of the rider.
@quadassault_destroyed=Your Basilisk has been destroyed.

@quadstealth=Wraith
@quadstealthd=Destroyed Wraith
@quadstealthinfo=The fastest and most agile of all land-based vehicles, the Wraith trades armor and all offensive capabilities for sheer speed, maneuverability, and stealth. Designed specifically as a reconnaissance vehicle, the Wraith has a unique light refraction system that effectively cloaks it visually at long range only if the rider is wearing a Stealth Suit. The integrated stealth system complements the light fraction, removing the Wraith from most radar systems. In addition a white noise generator helps to dampen the Wraith's engine noise.
@quadstealth_destroyed=Your Wraith has been destroyed.

@fury=Fury
@furyd=Destroyed Fury
@furyinfo=This variant of the traditional Basilisk still has light armor and a high maximum speed, but instead of 12mm chainguns, it now mounts a fixed-forward Hellfire Rocket Launcher. This heavy ordnance rocket is designed to punch large holes in armored targets and it was mounted to a Basilisk chassis so it could be delivered quickly to target, getting rapidly under that target's big guns before being destroyed, but with enough time to destroy the enemy in return.\n\nThe Hellfire can be pivoted up/down for ease of targeting, but side-to-side aiming must be done via steering the Fury itself.
@fury_destroyed=Your Fury has been destroyed.

@vanguard=Vanguard
@vanguardd=Destroyed Vanguard
@vanguardinfo=The Vanguard is the main battle tank for the New Conglomerate. Generally well balanced, the Vanguard brings decent speed, solid armor, and hefty firepower to the field. The main turret pivots 360 degrees and houses a 150mm Tank Cannon. The gunner can also switch to a limited pivot 20mm Recoilless Cannon for infantry supression.
@vanguard_destroyed=Your Vanguard has been destroyed.

@lightning=Lightning
@lightningd=Destroyed Lightning
@lightninginfo=The Lightning is a single seated mini tank which is fairly fast but lacking much in the way of armor, making it best suited to running escort or in packs. The Lightning is outfitted with a 75mm Tank Cannon as its primary weapon. Next to the Cannon is a secondary Light Rotary Chaingun used as an anti-infantry weapon.
@lightning_destroyed=Your Lightning has been destroyed.

@prowler=Prowler
@prowlerd=Destroyed Prowler
@prowlerinfo=The Prowler is the largest Main Battle Tank. Having the most armor for a Tank and a 360-degree capable dual 100mm heavy tank turret, the Prowler is certainly able to devastate many targets in short order. The secondary gunner is able to control a 15mm dual-rotary chaingun which is a small turret stacked upon the primary turret. Naturally the sheer size, weight, and firepower of this tank makes it slower than any of the Main Battle tanks.
@prowler_destroyed=Your Prowler has been destroyed.

@magrider=Magrider
@magriderd=Destroyed Magrider
@magriderinfo=The Magrider is the Vanu Sovereignty's Main Battle Tank.\n\nBuilt upon Vanu Alien technology, it has the ability to hover across both ground and water.\n\nThis propulsion system also gives the Magrider the ability to strafe left or right. The drawback, however, is that the Sovereignty has not perfected the anti-gravitic drive yet so weight is still a critical issue.\n\nBecause of this, their primary weapon, a heavy energy rail beam has a limited forward pivot.\n\nThe secondary weapon system, which the pilot controls, is a light Pulsed Particle Accelerator, and is mounted on the front of the vehicle.  
@magrider_destroyed=Your Magrider has been destroyed.

@mosquito=Mosquito
@mosquitod=Destroyed Mosquito
@mosquitoinfo=The Mosquito is fast, agile, and lightly armored. It carries only a Light Rotary Chaingun (12mm), but it can easily slip past most sensory defenses (it's not visible on radar) and is primarily a scout craft. The Mosquito only carries a single pilot.
@mosquito_destroyed=Your Mosquito has been destroyed.

@lightgunship=Reaver
@lightgunshipd=Destroyed Reaver
@lightgunshipinfo=The Reaver carries much more armor and ordnance than the lighter Mosquito. Of course, this makes it less maneuverable, but the Reaver is easily the king of the skies with its forward-firing 20mm Recoilless Cannon and secondary firing Rocket Launchers. The Reaver, like the Mosquito, carries only a single pilot.
@lightgunship_destroyed=Your Reaver has been destroyed.

@phantasm=Phantasm
@phantasmd=Destroyed Phantasm
@phantasminfo=The Phantasm is a stealth transport aircraft capable of carrying four passengers in addition to the pilot.  It has no weapons and is less manuverable than other smaller aircraft.  It makes up for this lack of fighting ability with the addition of stealth devices so it can avoid enemies instead.
@phantasm_destroyed=Your Phantasm has been destroyed.

@dropship=Galaxy
@dropshipd=Destroyed Galaxy
@dropshipinfo=The Galaxy is a gigantic aircraft capable of carrying a pilot, three gunners, two MAXs, six other passengers, as well as a vehicle in the back (with passengers). Fully loaded, with passengers in the vehicle stowed in back, the Galaxy can easily carry a full Squad of soldiers, plus a pilot and gun crew to bring them to the battle intact and alive. The gunner positions have 20mm Chainguns fitted with special coolant units that allow faster rate of fire to use in defense against airborne targets, or they can be alternately used to pound ground targets from above.
@dropship_destroyed=Your Galaxy has been destroyed.

@galaxy_gunship=Galaxy Gunship
@galaxy_gunshipd=Destroyed Galaxy Gunship
@galaxy_gunshipinfo=This aircraft is just as it sounds: a Galaxy that has been modified from a transport vehicle to an assault vehicle.  It can carry a pilot and up to 5 gunners.\n\nEquipped to handle any battle situation, the guns include rotary 35mm chainguns on the wings and tail, as well as 2 modified rotary Ground Pounders in the front.
@galaxy_gunship_destroyed=Your Galaxy Gunship has been destroyed.

@orbital_shuttle=High Altitude Reentry Transport (HART)

@ams=Adv. Mobile Station (AMS)
@amsd=Destroyed Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)
@amsinfo=The Advanced Mobile Station is the lynchpin in many attack strategies. Once driven to a location and deployed, the AMS allows soldiers to store their patterns at its respawning tubes for quick redeployment after death. It also carries two full Equipment Terminals allowing soldiers to reequip in the field. When deployed, the AMS automatically cloaks beyond a short distance in order to better shield it from enemy troops.
@ams_destroyed=Your Advanced Mobile Station has been destroyed.
@ams_decaystarted=The AMS you are bound to has lost its' owner.  It will auto-deconstruct in 15 minutes.
@ams_decaystarted_sound=spawn07.wav

@ams_decayed_sound=spawn07.wav
@ams_deconstructed=The AMS you are bound to has been deconstructed by its owner.

@ant=Adv. Nanite Transport (ANT)
@antd=Destroyed Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)
@antinfo=The Advanced Nanite Transport is the backbone of the system to draw energy from the ancient Vanu warp bubbles.\n\nThe ANT is usable by all members of all Empires who have any other vehicle certification.\n\nThe ANT is driven to warp gate bubbles where it deploys its charging vanes.\n\nOnce the capacitors onboard are filled, the ANT is driven to a battle facility and deployed near a Silo. The energy then coruscates over to the Silo collector and the facility gains enough energy to be fully powered for a time.
@ant_destroyed=Your ANT has been destroyed.

@apc=Sunderer
@apcd=Destroyed Sunderer
@apcinfo=The Sunderer is a large, lumbering heavy ground transport capable of carrying a driver, two gunners, six passengers, and two MAXs. The gunners man two large 75mm Tank Cannons to be used in defense against vehicles, but depend on squad members disembarking to protect against infantry attack.
@apc_destroyed=Your Sunderer has been destroyed.
@apc_nc=Vindicator
@apc_ncinfo=The Vindicator is the NC Sunderer variant: a large, lumbering heavy ground transport capable of carrying a driver, six gunners, two passengers, and two MAXs. The gunners man two large 75mm Tank Cannons to be used in defense against vehicles, two 20mm cannons to be used primarily against pursuing aircraft, and two side ballguns that can detect cloaked objects and mow down infantry.\n\nThe Vindicator is able to penetrate some types of defensive shields and the driver can release a rechargeable EMP blast that jams all nearby enemy equipment.
@apc_nc_destroyed=Your Vindicator has been destroyed.
@apc_tr=Juggernaut
@apc_trinfo=The Juggernaut is the TR Sunderer variant: a large, lumbering heavy ground transport capable of carrying a driver, six gunners, two passengers, and two MAXs. The gunners man two large 75mm Tank Cannons to be used in defense against vehicles, two 15mm chainguns to be used primarily against pursuing aircraft, and two side ballguns that can detect cloaked objects and mow down infantry.\n\nThe Juggernaut is able to penetrate some types of defensive shields and the driver can release a rechargeable EMP blast that jams all nearby enemy equipment.
@apc_tr_destroyed=Your Juggernaut has been destroyed.
@apc_vs=Leviathan
@apc_vsinfo=The Leviathan is the VS Sunderer variant: a large, lumbering heavy ground transport capable of carrying a driver, six gunners, two passengers, and two MAXs. The gunners man two large 75mm Tank Cannons to be used in defense against vehicles, two flux cannons to be used primarily against pursuing aircraft, and two side ballguns that can detect cloaked objects and mow down infantry.\n\nThe Leviathan is able to penetrate some types of defensive shields and the driver can release a rechargeable EMP blast that jams all nearby enemy equipment.
@apc_vs_destroyed=Your Leviathan has been destroyed.

@mediumtransport=Deliverer
@mediumtransportd=Destroyed Deliverer
@mediumtransportinfo=The Deliverer is a medium transport capable of carrying up to five occupants (1 driver, 2 gunners, 2 passengers). While less maneuverable than assault buggies, the Deliverer has two gunners -- one next to the driver, facing forward, the other in the rear, covering the back. A reasonable trunk provides adequate space to carry supplies as well.\n\nThe Deliverer also has the distinct advantage of being able to cross calm rivers and waterways. When entering water, the Deliverer will float at the surface, but is only capable of 70% of its maximum speed when crossing water.
@mediumtransport_destroyed=Your Deliverer has been destroyed.

@battlewagon=Raider
@battlewagond=Destroyed Raider
@battlewagoninfo=The Raider is a medium transport capable of carrying up to five occupants (One driver and four gunners). While less maneuverable than the original Deliverer, this TR-specific variant has 4 gunners, all in 360-degree turrets capable of covering all angles around the vehicle.\n\nThe Raider also carries slightlier heavier armor than the original Deliverer, although at the cost of a bit of handling and top speed.\n\nLike the Deliverer, the Raider has the advantage of being able to cross calm rivers and waterways, although at a slightly slower speed than the original Deliverer due to its increased weight.
@battlewagon_destroyed=Your Raider has been destroyed.

@thunderer=Thunderer
@thundererd=Destroyed Thunderer
@thundererinfo=The Thunderer is a medium transport capable of carrying four passengers, plus the driver. Two of those passengers have access to the Gauss Cannon weapon systems. These Gauss Cannons are potent anti-armor weapons. They can be used as anti-infantry weapons, but are less situated to that task due to the small explosion radius of their ordnance.
@thunderer_destroyed=Your Thunderer has been destroyed.

@aurora=Aurora
@aurorad=Destroyed Aurora
@aurorainfo=The Aurora is a medium transport capable of carrying four passengers, plus the driver. Two of those passengers have access to the Flux Pod Launcher weapon systems. These Flux Pod Launchers can be used to support dismounted infantry with indirect salvos of rocket-like Flux Pods after they leave the Aurora and head toward a target, thus increasing the likelihood of them surviving the trip.\n\nThe Aurora also carries slightlier heavier armor than the original Deliverer, although at the cost of a bit of handling and top speed.\n\nLike the Deliverer, the Aurora has the advantage of being able to cross calm rivers and waterways, although at a slightly slower speed than the original Deliverer due to its increased weight.

@vultureinfo=The Vulture is a fast attack support bomber variant of the Liberator.  It has lightened armor from the Liberator, providing improved handling and speed and an afterburner system.  The Vulture is designed to attack vehicle targets and is crewed by three soldiers. The nose cannon delivers a powerful burst of rapid fire armor piercing slugs while the bomb bay has been modified to deliver heavy tankbuster bombs, making it the AV support platform that it is.
@vulture_destroyed=Your Vulture has been destroyed.

@wasp=Wasp
@waspd=Destroyed Wasp
@waspinfo=The Wasp is the interceptor variant of the Mosquito.  It carries air-to-air guided missiles, and a rapid-fire chaingun that delivers short bursts of 12mm explosive bullets.\n\nIn addition, the Wasp is fitted with a high-capacity afterburner that allows extended use, but at the cost of higher recharging time.\n\nThe Wasp's primary weakness is its thin armor, which is significantly lighter than the Mosquito's. It also lacks the Mosquito's radar overflight capability.
@wasp_destroyed=Your Wasp has been destroyed.

@flail=Flail
@flaild=Destroyed Flail
@flailinfo=The Flail is an Ancient-Tech (AT) Artillery Platform. This single-person vehicle is driven to a location and then deployed from inside the vehicle. The vehicle then becomes a stationary turret that fires incredibly long-ranged projectiles that create devastating damage at their impact location.
@flail_destroyed=Your Flail has been destroyed.

@router=Router
@routerd=Destroyed Router
@routerinfo=The Router is an Ancient-Tech (AT) mobile point-to-point teleport system.\n\nThis single-person vehicle is driven to a location and then deployed from inside the vehicle. An access point then becomes available from inside the craft allowing you to grab a 'telepad' object.\n\nThe telepad requires inventory space, so you'll need to clear space in your inventory to grab it.\n\nTo deploy the telepad, equip it and then click the left-mouse button while looking at the ground (much like deploying a mine or Spitfire turret).\n\nOnce the Telepad is deployed, you can instantly move between Router and Telepad by moving into the glowing energy column.\n\nNOTE: This device is *not* IFF. Enemies can use it just as well as friendlies.
@router_destroyed=Your Router has been destroyed.

@switchblade=Switchblade
@switchbladed=Destroyed Switchblade
@switchbladeinfo=The Switchblade is an Ancient-Tech (AT) hovercycle that converts to a steady field turret with devastating firepower.\n\nThis single-person vehicle can be driven like a hovercycle. It's exceedingly mobile and has a forward-firing Scythe energy cannon.\n\nHowever, the Switchblade's flexibility comes in the design allowing it to deploy and convert into a field turret.\n\nWhen deployed, the Switchblade's Scythe cannon rate of fire increases dramatically and can be rotated 360-degrees for maximum fire coverage.
@switchblade_destroyed=Your Switchblade has been destroyed.

@vanu_sentry_turret=Ancient Sentry Turret
@vanu_sentry_turretd=Destroyed Ancient Sentry Turret
@vanu_sentry_turretinfo=The Ancient Sentry Turret draws power directly from the sources flowing through the structures and the very walls of the caverns themselves.\n\nThe turret can be manned by any Empire, regardless of whether any nearby buildings are captured or not.\n\nWhen a turret is manned, the name above it will be red or green, signifying whether an enemy or friendly is in the turret.\n\nThe AST's shots are rapid and are particularly effective against infantry and air targets.
@vanu_sentry_turret_destroyed=Your Ancient Sentry Turret has been destroyed.
@vanu_sentry_turret_firemode1=Ionic Burst

@lodestar=Lodestar
@lodestard=Destroyed Lodestar
@lodestarinfo=The Lodestar is a single-crew vehicle that can lift and carry any ground vehicle quickly and smoothly to a desired location.\n\nVehicles mounted in the Lodestar can be ejected in order to 'hot drop' to an overflown location.\n\nThe Lodestar can also be used by ground and air vehicles as a repair/rearm terminal when the Lodestar is landed.
@lodestar_destroyed=Your Lodestar has been destroyed.

@aphelion_flight=Eclipse
@aphelion_flightd=Destroyed Eclipse
@aphelion_flightinfo=The Eclipse is the Vanu Sovereignty's implementation of a BattleFrame Robotics Flight Variant. This one-man flight configuration can be outfitted with any of the pilot weapons, including the NTU Siphon and the Armor Siphon. It also carries Jet Packs that will allow it to launch itself into the air and fly short distances.\n\nBattleFrame Robotics feature a powerful shield that absorbs significant amounts of damage.  However, the Flight Variant must divert most of the system's energy to the flight and movement systems and therefore it's shield systems are not as powerful as the 2 man gunner versions.  As such, the Flight Variant BFRs rely on their speed and maneuverability and act as fast attack vehicles.  \n\nAll BFRs can crouch to divert movement energy to shield regeneration.

# Optionally, each entry gets:
#	1) chat text to send: *Msg_<name> 
#	2) an emote name
# 3) the letter to append to the root sound V234 - where each level fills in 2,3,or4
# If the chat text contains %s. The chat msg of the
# selection for that level is inserted.
# The chat text is searched from parent down. 
# 
# The UI builder needs the bit after the underscore as the name.
# The UI builder needs the full "@VoiceL<N>_<Name>" as Text
# It will look for the shortcut, message text, emote automatically

# Implant Description Strings
#---------------------------------------------------------
@ImplantTerminalTitle=Implant Terminal
@Advanced_Regen_Descrip=Regeneration allows you to use Stamina points to quickly regenerate missing Health points at the cost of two Stamina points for each Health point regained.
@Targeting_Descrip=Enhanced Targeting allows you to see the health of enemy characters under your reticule. It also reveals the names of enemies within a vehicle.
@Audio_Amplifier_Descrip=This implant analyzes footstep reverberations of nearby soldiers, allowing onboard systems to analyze that sound and place enemy soldier locations on your personal radar, thus revealing their position when they are running.
@Darklight_Vision_Descrip=The Darklight implant greatly reduces your normal visibility while simultaneously shifting your perceptions to allow you to see cloaked enemies in an area around you.
@Melee_Booster_Descrip=This implant drains a soldier's Stamina when he swings a knife, but greatly enhances the damage of that knife when it hits.
@Personal_Shield_Descrip=This implant harnesses a soldier's Stamina and turns it into a personal force field that blocks incoming damage on a one for one basis.
@Range_Magnifier_Descrip=This implant is used instead of a weapon's normal zoom function, but has much greater capacity. Zoom levels are 4x, 8x, and 12x.
@Second_Wind_Descrip=When a soldier is on the brink of death, the Second Wind implant automatically boosts Health and Stamina to safer levels. After each use, a recharge period must elapse before Second Wind can be used again.
@Silent_Run_Descrip=Using ECM technology, the Sensor Shield implant screens the user from motion sensors, Mosquito overflight radar, and most radar. The user needs to be aware that the screening does not work when equipment is operated by the user. In other words, if you use any item, or take damage, your Sensor Shield will temporarily fail, revealing you on the Proximity Maps of enemy soldiers.\n\nThe larger the armor worn by the user, the more Stamina is consumed to screen the armor away from sensors.
@Surge_Descrip=This implant boosts the footspeed of a soldier by draining his Stamina to power enhanced leg units. The bulkier the armor being worn, the more Stamina is required to achieve the Surge in speed. No items may be equipped while the Surge is in use, so care must be taken when using this implant near combat situations.

@CertDescription_combat_engineering=Allows use of the ACE combat device. The ACE is used to generate nanite construction of the following objects: HE Mine, Motion Alarm Sensor, Spitfire deployable turret, and the Boomer HE.
@CertDescription_ce_defense=Allows use of the Field Deployable Unit, an advanced version of the ACE. Using the FDU, you can deploy Tactical Resonance Area Protections (TRAPs) at key locations. This certification also enhances your knowledge of the ACE, allowing you to deploy more objects than before and unlocking special cloaking and flak versions of the Spitfire Turret known as Shadow and Cerberus Turrets.  Furthermore, you will now be able to use the Nano-Dispenser to upgrade your base's wall turrets to shoot anti-vehicle or flak projectiles for a short time.  Finally, you may charge any Aegis Shield Generator with a Nano-Dispenser to create a physical shield that no projectile or enemy vehicle can pass through.
@CertDescription_ce_offense=Allows use of the Field Deployable Unit, an advanced version of the ACE. Using the FDU, you can deploy empire-specific manned Field Turrets and the Aegis Shield Generator. This certification also enhances your knowledge of the ACE, allowing you to deploy Spitfire Turrets in an enemy SOI and unlocking Disrupter Mines, which have a jamming effect on infantry and vehicles.  Finally, you may charge any Aegis Shield Generator with a Nano-Dispenser, allowing it to supply ammunition for a short time.
@CertDescription_ce_advanced=For only the most dedicated engineers, this certification combines all the features of Fortification Engineering and Assault Engineering.
@CertDescription_bfr_basic=Allows access, with the Core Combat Expansion, to the basic configuration of your Empire's BattleFrame Robotics: Aphelion (VS), Colossus (TR), Peregrine (NC) and their corresponding Anti Vehicular weapon loadouts.
@CertDescription_bfr_ai_gunnery=Allows BFR Pilots access to Empire specific Anti Infantry weapon loadouts.
@CertDescription_bfr_aa_gunnery=Allows BFR Pilots access to Empire specific Anti Aircraft weapon loadouts.
@CertDescription_switchblade=Allows access, with the Core Combat expansion, to the Switchblade, a mobile hover vehicle that can be deployed as an anti-infantry field turret.
@CertDescription_phantasm=Allows access to the Phantasm, a small transport aircraft with stealth abilities.  Only available to users with knowledge of other stealth systems.
@CertDescription_expert_hacking=Expert Hackers have a great amount of experience with the Remote Electronics Kit, allowing them to hack even faster than before. Their skills in jacking vehicles have increased, and can now jack manned vehicles (booting all occupants) and steal enemy Field Turrets. They are capable of boosting pain fields for a limited amount of time, and can give the Aegis Shield Generator enhanced radar stealth and enemy detection. Finally, they are the only hackers capable of purging a virus from an electronic system.
@CertDescription_virus_hacking=Underground hackers have developed a new kind of Remote Electronics Kit called the 'T-REK' that is capable of infecting systems with a virus that corrupts electronic data. Once infected, equipment will fail to function properly, and the effects are different for each device. Viruses can be installed at a facility via the Main Terminal or in a number of other types of equipment. Each T-REK also comes charged with a limited number of bolts that can transmit a virus into vehicles remotely, causing a temporary malfunction in the vehicle's control systems.
@CertDescription_electronics_expert=For only the most dedicated hackers, this certification combines all the features of Expert Hacking and Data Corruption.

@xp_flamethrower_label=Weapon: Dragon
@xp_flamethrower_descrip=You have equipped the Dragon.
@xp_flamethrower_message=DRAGON\n\nThe Dragon is a powerful flamethrower that works best at close ranges.\n\nThe first fire mode unleashes a stream of fire.  This stream can be released in moderately short bursts or until your fuel is gone.  The fire moves slowly and is very short-ranged, but it is devastating to anyone that gets caught in it.\n\nThe second fire mode launches a concentrated ball of fire called a Sunburst that will explode after a short time or when it hits the ground.  The Sunburst's explosion deals massive damage to anyone in range.  This firemode requires much more fuel than the standard stream, so try make your shots count.\n\nThe fire damage incurred from both fire modes will not only directly hurt soldiers through their armor, but ignites them as well, dealing damage until the fire has been extinguished.

@xp_lancer_label=Weapon: Lancer
@xp_lancer_descrip=You have equipped the Lancer beam rifle.
@xp_lancer_message=LANCER\n\nThe Vanu Soverignty's Lancer is a heavy beam rifle specifically engineered for use against vehicles and MAX armor.  Although still potent against softer targets, the Lancer punches through armor spectacularly well.

@xp_lasher_label=Weapon: Lasher
@xp_lasher_descrip=You have equipped the Lasher heavy energy rifle.
@xp_lasher_message=LASHER\n\nThe Lasher's energy projectile is slow, however, if it impacts a target, it does impressive damage.\n\nThe Lasher 'orb' also seeks nearby targets and lashes out energy tendrils toward that target, so that even a near-miss can still do damage.\n\nThis results in a particularly lethal weapon when used against squads in close formation.

@xp_magcutter_label=Weapon: MAG-cutter
@xp_magcutter_descrip=You have equipped the MAG-cutter, the fall-back weapon of the New Conglomerate.

@xp_oicw_label=Weapon: Scorpion
@xp_oicw_descrip=You have equipped the Scorpion missile launcher.
@xp_oicw_message=SCORPION\n\nA weapon designed for outdoor assault, the Scorpion uses range-finder technology to fire 'smart' missiles from long distances.\n\nTo use, first zoom in on a distant target.  Then, change fire modes to store the distance to that target.  When your reticle turns red, you are ready to fire.  The object you fire at does not necessarily have to be the same object you target for a distance lock.  Zooming out or switching fire modes again will remove your lock.\n\nOnce fired, each missile will fly the stored distance and detonate.  This explosion only deals a small amount of damage, but unleashes many smaller explosives in a downward direction that are capable of dealing more damage themselves.\n\nIf either the Scorpion missile or secondary explosive hits an object before detonating, the mechanism will malfunction and become a dud.

@xp_phoenix_label=Weapon: Decimator
@xp_phoenix_descrip=You have equipped the Decimator disposable missile launcher.
@xp_phoenix_message=DECIMATOR\n\nThe warhead of this disposable missile launcher is extremely powerful, but the weapon carries only three shots and cannot be reloaded.\n\nThe Decimator projectile is unguided and relatively slow, so you should lead your target carefully for best results.\n\nThe weapon's secondary mode transmits visuals from the projectile's attached camera, which can be used to spy out remote positions.

@xp_scythe_descrip=You are driving the Switchblade and have access to the Scythe weapon.
@xp_scythe_message=SCYTHE\n\nThe Scythe cannon fires v-shaped wedges of energy. These wide projectiles make it easier to hit objects in that they will detonate as soon as any part of their wedge brushes against a target.\n\nThe Scythe's projectiles impact on the fourth-dimension as well, thus they tend to ignore objects which don't have a large presence in the fourth dimension. In other words, if an object hasn't been there very long (as with soldiers), the projectile will pass through them, damaging them along the way, but continuing on until it hits an 'older' object that has traction on the fourth dimension.\n\nAdditionally, when the Switchblade is properly deployed, the Scythe's rate of fire increases dramatically enabling the driver to inundate an area with projectiles, suppressing or destroying enemies to draw fire and protect other elements on the move.\n\nYou can recharge your Scythe by either driving near a Vehicle Recharge Crystal (in the caverns) or driving to a facility that has a Vehicle Module installed aboveground.

@xp_fury_message=FURY\n\nThis variant of the Basilisk still has light armor and a high max speed, but instead of 12mm chainguns it now mounts a Hellfire Rocket Launcher.\n\nThis rocket is designed to punch holes in armored targets, and mounting it on a Basilisk chassis allows the driver to get a target's big guns and deliver the ordnance.

@xp_skyguard_label=Vehicle: Skyguard
@xp_skyguard_descrip=You are facing the Skyguard anti-aircraft light armor support vehicle.
@xp_skyguard_message=SKYGUARD\n\nThis two-crew buggy has a driver forward and a gunner behind.\n\nThe gunner can choose between firing a fast-firing Flak Cannon, which is devastating against aircraft, or an anti-personnel 12mm machinegun.\n\nThe Skyguard has no anti-armor weaponry, so it's usually wise to flee from tank encounters.\n\nAs with all buggies, the Skyguard takes reduced damage from High Explosive Mines.

@xp_threemanheavybuggy_label=Vehicle: Marauder
@xp_threemanheavybuggy_descrip=You are facing the Marauder light armor support vehicle.
@xp_threemanheavybuggy_message=MARAUDER\n\nThis highly mobile three-man buggy has enhanced armor protection, and two mounted weapons for gunners to operate.\n\nThe 12mm Chaingun and GroundPounder Launcher make this buggy lethal against both infantry and hard targets up to lightly armored tanks.\n\nAs with all buggies, the Marauder takes reduced damage from High Explosive Mines.

@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_label=Vehicle: Harasser
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_descrip=You are facing the Harasser light armor scout vehicle.
@xp_two_man_assault_buggy_message=HARASSER\n\nThe Harasser is a light harrying vehicle designed for rapid transit and hit-and-run assaults.\n\nThe two-man buggy carries a 12mm rotary chaingun in the gunner seat for use against soft targets, while the driver concentrates on manuevers.\n\nThe Harasser's low profile and light armor just manages to avoid making it dense enough for wall turret scanners. Therefore, unless detected by a Motion Sensor the Harasser will not be fired upon by Phalanx Wall Turrets.\n\nAs with all buggies, the Harasser takes reduced damage from High Explosive Mines.

@xp_twomanheavybuggy_label=Vehicle: Enforcer
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_descrip=You are facing the Enforcer light armor support vehicle.
@xp_twomanheavybuggy_message=ENFORCER\n\nThis lightly armored buggy sports a Firebird advanced rocket launcher system, making it a powerful opponent to heavy armor.\n\nWhile it can't take a punch well, its light profile and weight make it a difficult target for heavy ordnance, and makes this vehicle something tank commanders fear.\n\nAs with all buggies, the Enforcer takes reduced damage from High Explosive Mines.

@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_label=Vehicle: Thresher
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_descrip=You are facing the Thresher light armor scout hovercraft.
@xp_twomanhoverbuggy_message=THRESHER\n\nThis light hovercraft has a Flux Cannon mounted in the passenger position for use against infantry and light armor.\n\nIts hovercraft abilities allow this vehicle to travel over water, as well as allowing it to strafe left and right, thus making it extremely maneuverable.\n\nAs with all buggies, the Thresher takes reduced damage from High Explosive Mines.

@xp_vulture_label=Vehicle: Vulture
@xp_vulture_descrip=You are facing the Vulture bomber.
@xp_vulture_message=VULTURE\n\nThis bomber is a specialized variation of the Liberator. It has been modified to allow the use of an afterburn on the engine systems. Also, the nose cannon has been adjusted to rapid fire bursts of 75 heavy armor piercing rounds. The bomb bay has been adjusted to only drop high yield tank buster bombs. These changes are intended to make the Vulture a terror on enemy armor units, coming in low and fast to strike quickly, decimating tank or other armor units and then escaping anti air fire quickly. The Vulture is only available to certified pilots who have the Bomber Ace Bronze award.

@xp_wasp_label=Vehicle: Wasp
@xp_wasp_descrip=You are facing the Wasp interceptor.
@xp_wasp_message=WASP\n\nThe interceptor variant of the Mosquito, the Wasp is the most lethal dogfighter in the skies.\n\nIt carries air-to-air guided missiles, and a rapid-fire chaingun that delivers short bursts of 12mm explosive bullets.\n\nIn addition, the Wasp is fitted with a high-capacity afterburner that allows extended use, but at the cost of higher recharging time.\n\nThe Wasp's primary weakness is its thin armor, which is significantly lighter than the Mosquito's. It also lacks the Mosquito's radar overflight capability.

The color of the hacking support icon near friendly players' names will also reflect the hacking level.\n\nThe colors are as follows:\nNo certification = YELLOW\nHacking = RED\nAdvanced Hacking = PURPLE\nExpert Hacking = BLUE\n\nThe T-REK's beam color is always GREEN, regardless of certification.

@xp_rek_targets_label=Hackable Objects
@xp_rek_targets_message=Here is a list of objects that can be hacked with the REK and the effects of the hack:\n\nCONTROL CONSOLE: Capture a base.\n\nDOOR LOCK: Disable (or reenable) the IFF functionality of the door lock to unlock the door.\n\nMEDICAL / CERTIFICATION / IMPLANT TERMINALS: Access an enemy terminal. Requires Hacking.\n\nLOCKER: Access an enemy locker. Requires Hacking.\n\nEQUIPMENT / BFR / VEHICLE TERMINALS: Access an enemy terminal. Requires Advanced Hacking.\n\nVEHICLES: Jack an unoccupied vehicle, making it your own. Requires Advanced Hacking. Expert Hackers can jack occupied vehicles.\n\nFIELD TURRET: Jack a field turret to deconstruct it. Requires Advanced Hacking. Expert Hackers can steal turrets instead of deconstructing them.\n\nMATRIXING PANEL: Increase the strength of the nearby spawn room's pain field for 30 minutes. Requires Expert Hacking.\n\nGENERATOR TERMINAL: Increase the strength of the nearby generator's pain field for 30 minutes. Requires Expert Hacking.\n\nAEGIS SHIELD GENERATOR: Gives the Aegis greater radar benefits, so that any friendly unit inside the bubble is cloaked from enemy radar. Players inside the bubble will also be able to see nearby enemy units on radar as if they had the Interlink benefit. Requires Expert Hacking.\n\nINFECTED OBJECTS: Removes the effects of the T-REK's virus. Requires Expert Hacking.

@xp_trek_label=Equipment: T-REK
@xp_trek_descrip=You have equipped the T-REK.
@xp_trek_message=T-REK\n\nThe T-REK is a Remote Electronics Kit modified for the sole purpose of uploading viruses into enemy machinery.\n\nIts primary fire mode makes use of a focusing lens to shoot a virus in the form of a concentrated data feed into enemy vehicles.  This will infect a vehicle's control system for a short time, reducing its speed and handling.  This mode has a limited number of uses and cannot be recharged.\n\nThe T-REK's secondary firemode is used to interface with enemy terminals and equipment to upload a virus, much like hacking with the REK.  Refer to the Field Manual for a complete list of susceptible objects.

@xp_trek_targets_label=Hackable Objects
@xp_trek_targets_message=Here is a list of objects that can be infected with the TREK and the effects of each virus:\n\nMAIN TERMINAL: Install a virus into the main network of the base. Enemy empires will not be able to tell when your empire has infected a Main Terminal for a short time after the virus is installed. The effects of the virus change depending on the type:\n  UNLOCK ALL DOORS: Disables IFF of all door locks in the base for one hour.\n  DOUBLE NTU RESOURCE DRAIN: Doubles the amount of resources expended by the base to repair its equipment. Lasts for one hour.\n  ACCESS EQUIPMENT TERMINALS: Allow anyone to access any of the base's Equipment Terminals for the next two minutes, regardless of their empire.\n  DISABLE ENEMY RADAR: Completely disables the radar of all units of the base's empire while in the SOI. The effect is similar to that of an EMP and lasts for 15 minutes.\n  DISABLE LINKED BENEFITS: Disables the effect of all linked facility benefits and vanu module benefits, even if the benefits originate from the infected base. However, the effect does not break the link to other bases and only lasts for 15 minutes.\n\nWALL TURRET: Infected wall turrets shoot their own empire instead of enemy empires while operating in automatic mode.\n\nSPITFIRE TURRET: Spitfires and their variants will shoot at their own empire instead of enemy empires.\n\nMOTION ALARM SENSOR: Infected Motion Sensors will detect friendly units instead of enemies and display them as red blips on the radar, even when not moving or in the sensor's line of sight.\n\nAEGIS SHIELD GENERATOR: Infected shield generators will emit a pain field that damages any friendly units inside its bubble.

@xp_map96_label=Map: Nexus
@xp_map96_descrip=You have arrived at Nexus
@xp_map96_message=NEXUS\n\nThe chill of this island emanates from its permafrost foundations. A hill perimeter surrounds a Dropship Center, which acts as the nerve center for the Oshur Cluster, linked to two warpgates and a geowarp.\n\nThis critical island lynchpin connects Extinction to Ascension, while having no connections at all to other planets (except for the geowarp connecting to a cavern when that cavern is active).\n\nTowers on the hill rim can only be accessed from footpaths on the outside of the hills, so be aware that they are different challenges to attack and defend.\n\nFoot trails (not wide enough for vehicles) will often take you to interesting objectives around the map. Look for foot trails from the warpgates that lead you to these hidden paths.

@xp_map97_label=Map: Desolation
@xp_map97_descrip=You have arrived at Desolation
@xp_map97_message=DESOLATION\n\nThis isle is a barren wasteland in the middle of a salty sea. However, it's great tank country.\n\nThe sand dunes that stretch across most of the island provide only enough cover for tanks to go 'hull down' against, and for infantry to use as LOS blocks. Squads of infantry and vehicles will do best here when coordinated as groups. Stragglers that try to cross the dunes alone are easy targets for snipers and air assault.\n\nAll three bases on this island are Technology Plants. Therefore, if you own at least one of the bases, you will always have access to advanced vehicles.\n\nThe lack of Bio Facilities here means that spawn times are not modified by anything but Modules, so those Modules are more important here.\n\nAll three facilities on this island are LLU bases, so targets will almost always be available out on the dunes. Stay wary!

@xp_map98_label=Map: Ascension
@xp_map98_descrip=You have arrived at Ascension
@xp_map98_message=ASCENSION\n\nThis island rises from the sea as a pile of stacked mesas and crumbling cliffs.\n\nA path runs from each warp point to one of the three facilities on the island, but there are also pedestrian switchback pathways up the sheer cliffside to allow quicker foot access to higher mesas.\n\nThe three facilities are neighbors to one another across the top of the mesa (via a crossover plateau), so defense of those areas is critical for control of this island.

@xp_map99_label=Map: Extinction
@xp_map99_descrip=You have arrived at Extinction
@xp_map99_message=EXTINCTION\n\nLong ago, geological stresses erupted here, pushing up through the sea floor and creating a volcano that spewed lava for a time before dying. Many years passed and erosion took its toll on the now dormant crater. When a great quake rumbled through this area mere decades ago, a new smaller volcano was born amidst the ruins of the older crater.\n\nNow, laval islands have been cut by wind, water, and steady erosion. The volcano is dormant for now, but who knows how long that will last.\n\nAlthough bridge battles are common on this island, water-based attacks are possible via grav vehicles and Deliverer variants. Shoreline access is possible at many strategic points on this map if bridge battles are blocking progress elsewhere.\n\nIf you're new to this island, try following the footpaths that have been worn into the ground. They'll lead you someplace interesting and then you can take it from there.

@xp_ugd01_label=Map: Supai
@xp_ugd01_descrip=You have arrived at the Supai cavern.
@xp_ugd01_message=SUPAI\n\nThis sandstone cavern has a river moving through it. This river bisects around a central island, where the Core Complex resides. Module and AT buildings are organized into complexes atop plateaus away from that Core Complex, (for reasons known only to the Ancients), but they are typically easier to defend because of this positioning.

@xp_ugd02_label=Map: Hunhau
@xp_ugd02_descrip=You have arrived at the Hunhau cavern.
@xp_ugd02_message=HUNHAU\n\nThis swampy, dank cavern has low-lying water areas near the geowarp tunnel entrances. From those swampy ponds, the plateaus build upward toward the center of the cavern where the Core Complex resides. Module buildings, AT plants, and the various smaller structures are scatttered around the perimeter of this central 'hill'.

@xp_ugd03_descrip=You have arrived at the Adlivun cavern.
@xp_ugd03_message=ADLIVUN\n\nLarge descending ice stalactites virtually merge into massive ice pillars rising from the floor throughout this area. AT Plants and Module buildings seem almost wedged between these two glacial structures to make unique-looking features in this icy cavern.

@xp_ugd04_label=Map: Byblos
@xp_ugd04_descrip=You have arrived at the Byblos cavern.
@xp_ugd04_message=BYBLOS\n\nThe massive lava river flowing through this cave, and the dramatic way in which the Core Complex is suspended in air above a giant lava pit in the center, makes Byblos a cavern to be remembered.\n\nBeware the lava. The crevices are unmarked and many an intrepid soldier has fallen to a hasty reconstruction by being unattentive.

@xp_ugd05_label=Map: Annwn
@xp_ugd05_descrip=You have arrived at the Annwn cavern.
@xp_ugd05_message=ANNWN\n\nSome Ancient device is being used to suspend ice platforms in various positions throughout this cavern. Small facilities, as well as the larger Module Buildings or AT Plants are sometimes on these platforms, making zip-lines extremely important here.\n\nAdditionally, the geowarp tunnels branch into high- and low-paths, allowing soldiers to move to the top and work down, or visa versa.\n\nNOTE: Module buildings are high up on the platforms. Invading Empires would be wise to bring AMSs so ground-level troops have useful respawn points near them.

@xp_form_squad_message=YOU FORMED A SQUAD\n\nAs the commander of your new squad, you now have the ability to add and kick members from the squad.\n\nTo gain CEP for a facility capture, your squad or platoon must fight within an SOI and kill enemy soldiers during the 15-minute hack. Experience gained is directly proportional to the number of UNIQUE players that you kill in that SOI, so its easier to get BEP or CEP in hotly contested areas. (Whereas uncontested caps will result in zero BEP/CEP.)\n\nNOTE: Commanders have their CEP awards scaled according to the size of their squad. Two players in a squad get 10% of max xp for a cap. Squads with eight or more members get 100% of max xp. It scales in between those end points.\n\n Command Experience is the only way for you to gain command rank, so don't forget this very important fact.

You also have other advantages, such as access to all empires' equipment and instant recall to the Black Ops HQ, which can launch drop pods anywhere in Auraxis.  However, you will be restricted to Agile and Rexo armor only, and your implants will be unavailable.\n\nInstead of hacking bases, you neutralize them.

You're currently in the basement of a friendly facility, but a battle is raging nearby.\n\nTo find the battle, hit 'M' to open your map screen and look for the nearby flashing Hot Spot indicator.\n\nNote the compass direction to that battle and then head on over there. Once you find the battle, you'll be able to figure out who is involved and what sort of fight is occurring. Enjoy!

@xp_drop_pod_label=Action: Use a Drop Pod
@xp_drop_pod_descrip=You are using an Orbital Drop Pod for the first time.
@xp_drop_pod_message=USING A DROP POD\n\nTo select your drop location, first double-click on a continent.  This takes you to the Continent View for that continent.\n\nThen click on the location you wish to drop on, and press the Launch Drop Pod button.\n\nThere is no way to leave the HART shuttle other than to drop, so suck it up soldier and DROP!

@xp_interstellar_map_label=Action: Use the Interstellar Map
@xp_interstellar_map_descrip=You are using the Interstellar Map for the first time.
@xp_interstellar_map_message=USING THE INTERSTELLAR MAP\n\nThis map is critical to your awareness of the warfare going on across the various planets, moons, and asteroids connected by the Auraxian Warpgate system.\n\nThe Interstellar View shows the destination stars you can reach via the Warpgate system. By clicking on either a star, or that star's planetary pane (the boxes on the right, left and top), you can easily see the links between your selected star and its destinations. The links are color-coded so that you can easily distinguish which Warpgate on your chosen planet goes to which Warpgate on your destination planet.\n\nThe various planets are on the left and right of the screen. Double-clicking either the star, or its planetary pane, takes you to a closer view of that location.\n\nAlong the top of the screen are four of the six caverns. Two of them are currently active, while the other two are inactive, but "on deck" until their turn arrives. A timer is shown over the "on deck" caverns so you know how long until they cycle to active status.\n\nGeowarps on the continents are shown by a green triangle, but it's easiest to see which continent has a link to a cavern by simply clicking on that cavern's pane and seeing where it's linked to currently.\n\nAlong the top of the screen (in the title bar) there are "action" buttons that let you toggle information on/off, let you see the map legend (so you can understand the icons more easily), or perform tasks like setting waypoints (and changing your view between map levels). If you're a commander, then your Battleplans are also accessed in this area.\n\nSome planets have multiple islands on a single world. These are called "clusters". (The Oshur Cluster is one such example.) When you double-click on a cluster, you go to a Cluster View, rather than directly to the Planetary View. This Cluster View allows you to see the intra-cluster lattice links and get a tactical overview of the Cluster before zooming in further. Double-click any of the islands in the Cluster view to move to its Planetary View.\n\nNOTE: If a continent is Empire Locked, it appear a solid color in either red, blue, or purple in the planet pane. If a continent is Population Locked, a lock icon will appear in the corner of the planet pane.

@xp_he_mine_message=HE MINE\n\nMines are placed by Combat Engineers using the Adaptive Construction Engine (ACE) on flat surfaces outdoors.\n\nOnce an enemy walks over a deployed mine, it will automatically detonate, dealing high explosive damage.\n\nEnemy mines can be safely detonated from a distance using a jammer grenade.

@xp_jammer_mine_label=Equipment: Disrupter Mine
@xp_jammer_mine_message=DISRUPTER MINE\n\nDisrupter Mines are placed by Assault Engineers using the change ammo function on the ACE.  They may be placed anywhere outdoors on a flat surface.\n\nIf an enemy walks over a deployed mine, it will automatically detonate, creating a temporary jamming effect which disables vehicle weapons and infantry implants.\n\nDisrupter Mines have been programmed not to detonate other explosives.

@GeneralHelpTab=Index
@HelpHelp=Help on Help
@HelpHelpText=This help system is available to answer common questions about PlanetSide's user interface and game mechanics.\n\nBrowse through the topics below and click on each heading to see sub-topics that may interest you.
@HelpHelpItem=Index
@HelpHelpItemText=The list on the left is the index of available help topics. Click on a header to select it and open its sub-topics list.
@HelpHelpContext=Context
@HelpHelpContextText=The '?' on many user interface items will bring you to the appropriate help topic for that window, making it easy to find focused help about an issue when you have questions.
@HelpArmor=Armor
@HelpArmorText=This section describes the many different types of armor you may choose on the Battlefield.
@HelpArmorNCMAX=NC MAXs
@HelpArmorNCMAXText=These MAX configurations are exclusive to the New Conglomerate. Its specialized ability is a shield that can absorb enemy fire for a limited amount of time.
@HelpArmorTRMAX=TR MAXs
@HelpArmorTRMAXText=These MAX configurations are exclusive to the Terran Republic. Its specialized ability is a anchor feature which increases their rate of fire and provides a tighter cone of fire.
@HelpArmorVSMAX=VS MAXs
@HelpArmorVSMAXText=These MAX configurations ar exclusive to the Vanu Sovereignty. Its specialized ability is a jumpjet that can be used to fly for a limited amount of time, at the expense of an increased cone of fire.
@HelpImplants=Implants
@HelpImplantsText=This section provides details on the various Implants available in the game so you can examine their abilities before selecting them.\n\nYou gain implants at Battle Ranks 6, 12, and 18, one per rank for a maximum of three Implants per soldier.\n\nMost Implants require Stamina as a power source, so you'll want to keep your Stamina as high as possible when preparing to use an Implant, because if you run out of Stamina, your implant ceases to work.\n\nNOTE: Jammer grenades shut down your Implant and force it to go through an activation timer (just as occurs when you initially purchase the Implant or after you die).
@HelpFrontend=Starting Screens
@HelpFrontendText=The 'Starting Screens' are the screens used to select your Empire, create and select your characters before entering a world. The Server Select screen is also described here.
@HelpFrontendServer=Server Select
@HelpFrontendServerText=This window lists the available Worlds you can choose.\n\nSelect a World and hit the NEXT button in the lower, right of the screen in order to connect to that World and begin a career in PlanetSide.\n\nYou can sort the columns by left-clicking the column's header. That way you can easily find which server has the best ping or which Empire needs players.\n\nThe 'Empire Needs' column shows you if one of the three Empires needs more characters on that particular server to balance the world population. You will usually receive incentives (bonuses to total health and experience) for joining an underdog Empire.
@HelpFrontendEmpire=Empire Select
@HelpFrontendEmpireText=The war rages between three different Empires: the Terran Republic, the New Conglomerate, and the Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nRead more about them by clicking on their respective logo buttons in the center of the screen.\n\nNOTE: You can only create characters from two of the three Empires on any particular world server.\n\nOnce you choose two Empires, those are your choices on that given world unless you first delete all your characters from one your current empires on this world server.\n\nTo select an Empire, click it, and then press the NEXT button in the lower, right of the screen.
@HelpFrontendCharacter=Character Select
@HelpFrontendCharacterText=The soldiers you have created for the selected World are available on this screen. Select one by clicking on that soldier's name.\n\nTo enter the world and begin playing, click the PLAY button in the lower right of the screen.\n\nTo delete the character, click the delete button under the bottom character slot.
@HelpFrontendCreate=Character Creation
@HelpFrontendCreateText=You create your soldiers here.\n\nEnter your soldier's name in the space provided at the top of the screen.\n\nThen select a gender (male/female) by clicking the appropriate gender button.\n\nSelect a face by scrolling through the available faces, and then pick a voice for your soldier by clicking and listening to the various voice sets available.\n\nWhen you have all your choices made, NEXT button in the lower, right of the screen in order to save the soldier and enter the world.
@HelpFrontendInstantAction=Starting Locations
@HelpFrontendInstantActionText=You have two choices as a beginning character. You can first appear in your Empire's Sanctuary, where you can use a HART shuttle to drop pod through the atmosphere, or travel to a Warpgate and through it, to continents dominated by your Empire. Or you can choose Instant Action. When you choose Instant Action, you are voluntarily deconstructing your soldier and allowing your Empire to determine where you would be best used to advance their causes.\n\nWhen this happens, you will be reconstructed in a facility or tower near to a "hot spot" on the continent.\n\nThat hotspot is easily seen. Your personal waypoint is placed on that hotspot upon your arrival, so you can find the battle you've been directed toward by just heading to the waypoint.\n\nThere are no guarantees what part of the world Instant Action will take you to...that's all dependent upon where the major battles are on Auraxis.
@HelpOptions=Options
@HelpOptionsText=This category provides information designed to refine and alter your game's performance characteristics, sound playback, keyboard layout, and more.\n\nClick on each of the areas indicated here to see the options available.
@HelpOptionKeymap=Keymapping
@HelpOptionKeymapText=To change a keystroke for a command to something more convenient to your style, just double-click on any key binding shown, and then type the key you wish to use for that command in the future.\n\nNOTE: If that key existed elsewhere in your key bindings, it will be removed from the old location and used here, so try to avoid conflicts.\n\nTo change mouse sensitivity or remap any mouse buttons, first click on the mouse icon. This brings up the mouse-specific controls for you to customize. To go back to keyboard bindings, just click on the keyboard icon.\n\nYou can see which keys are already in use by looking to the right side of the screen. The keys that are highlighted are already used.\n\nWhen you are done configuring your keyboard, you should SAVE it by hitting SAVE at the bottom of the screen. You can then LOAD your configuration at any time later, if you change key settings for any reason.
@HelpOptionVideo=Video Options
@HelpOptionVideoText=This area lets you change the appearance of your game. It is typically the place most people go to manipulate graphics to affect their framerate.
@HelpOptionVideoGeneral=General
@HelpOptionVideoGeneralText=Full Screen: If selected, the game will run in full screen mode. You will generally achieve better performance in this mode compared to windowed mode.\n\nScreen Resolution: Adjusts the video resolution of in-game play.\n\nAdaptive LOD: Use models with fewer polygons when the framerate is lower than the target framerate.\n\nGamma Settings: Gamma allows you to change the brightness and contrast of your screen, both darker and lighter. These can only be adjusted in full screen mode.\n\nVideo Quality: Video Quality is the most important setting on this screen. When you first enter the game, your system is polled to analyze your graphics card, sound card, and various hardware components. A setting in Video Quality is then chosen to maximize your framerate while delivering the highest level of quality for your machine. That setting is always Recommended. That means your game is set up the way our software thinks is best. Most people can leave their settings right there and be happy.\n\nSome folks like to customize things though. To customize your graphics, switch your Video Quality to 'Custom'. This allows you to access the following options...\n\nViewing Distance: WARNING! Reducing this distance will put you in situations where you cannot see another player (because your world ends closer than his does) but he can still see you. The only reason to use this slider is because you've tried all the other options and haven't gained enough framerate. This setting will dramatically reduce polygon count and is useful on our lower end CPUs and older video cards (for instance, you may want to do this on a 1.0 GHz CPU with a GeForce2 card).\n\nVideo Bit-Depth: 32-bit math is more precise and you'll see less 'swimming' in objects at distance if you leave this setting enabled. However, on lower CPU machines, 16-bit Video can save significant framerate.\n\nTexture Quality: The settings are High, Medium, and Low. Low setting will result in much blurrier textures, but will save a lot of RAM and VRAM for your machine, thus accelerating framerate for low-end systems. High resolution is only recommended for machines with lots of system RAM and video card RAM.\n\nParticle Effects: This affects your framerate mostly in combat situations. If you are seeing significant slowdowns during a firefight, you might consider turning down your particle effects. Particles are generally things like explosions, weapon effects, and impact effects.\n\nFlora Density:  Because the grass and bushes use alpha transparency, they can be slow on older video cards. If you are seeing a slow framerate when outside (it's fast inside), then consider turning down your Flora Density.\n\nMesh Detail: Increases the level of detail on 3D surfaces\n\nDraw Detail Web: This turns off the detail textures on grounds and walls. Although this can save you some memory, its generally a better visual effect to lower your texture resolution and leave Detail Textures 'on'. This results in a better close-up view of the art while still improving memory footprint.\n\nWarpgate Effect: Show the warpgate effect when objects pass through\n\nBullet Holes: These are the impact markers from grenade explosions, bullet impacts, beam effects, etc. This will only save a small amount of memory.\n\nShadows: Turning off shadows will save some CPU load and a bit of memory.\n\nWeather Particles: Because weather uses alpha transparency, it can be slow on some older video cards. Turning this switch off eliminates the actual rain and snow particles, but does not remove the fogging effect, so your game experience will still be the same as other players.\n\nSkydome: This turns off the sky. This can save significant memory and is recommended for 256MB machines.
@HelpOptionVideoAdvanced=Advanced
@HelpOptionVideoAdvancedText=If you want to see PlanetSide with maximum detail, go to the ADVANCED tab. This tab will only be available if you select "Custom" from the Video Quality option under General Video Options.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: DO NOT USE THIS unless you have more than 512MB of system RAM and at least 128MB of video card memory. By toggling these textures on, you will see the game in its highest texture precision...but they take a lot of memory. You can achieve great effect by increasing the resolution on specific categories of objects also, without turning them ALL on. This allows some improvements even if you can't afford the RAM glut for all high-res textures.\n\nTexture Quality: Use 32bit (DXT5) textures which require lots more memory, or use the 16bit (DXT1) textures\n\nVertical Sync: Limits the number of frames per second to the refresh rate of your monitor\n\nUse Triple Buffer: Allows your machine to begin the process of rendering frames in advance to create more fluid graphics at the expense of more system memory\n\nRender Shoreline Effect: Load and render shoreline effects at the water's edge.\n\nReserved Texture: Set the amount of memory to reserve for texture memory.\n\nCull Animations: Process animations at a lower rate in high-density situations.\n\nUse Detailed Vehicles: Use the original vehicle textures. They require additional memory.
@HelpOptionSound=Sound Options
@HelpOptionSoundText=You can customize your sound, music, and TeamSound voice controls here. 
@HelpOptionSoundSound=Sound
@HelpOptionSoundSoundText=Sound Driver: Choose the appropriate sound driver from the list provided. If you do not have a hardware sound accelerator, you should stick with DirectSound3D Software Emulation. If you have a hardware sound accelerator, then you should try at least straight DirectSound3D Hardware Support so that your soundcard does the work of manipulating sounds instead of your system CPU.\n\n2D Sound Effects Volume: This adjusts interface sounds (clicks of buttons, mouseover sounds, etc.) as well as some larger-scale sounds, like weather.\n\n3D Sound Effects Volume: This adjusts all the other sounds in the world that require 3D-positioning so that you can get a feel for where they are in the world from your speakers.\n\nEnvironmental Audio: This toggles environmental audio reverb effects.\n\nLow Quality Sound: If enabled, the game will use 8-bit sound files for increased performance, at the expense of reduced sound quality.
@HelpOptionSoundMusic=Music
@HelpOptionSoundMusicText=Play Music: This toggle enables or disables all music in game.\n\nMusic Volume: Adjusts the volume of the various music tracks.\n\nMusic Track Selection: Some folks have particular tastes in music. If you wish to turn off any particular music track, you can do so here.
@HelpOptionSoundVoice=Voice
@HelpOptionSoundVoiceText=TeamSound voice configuration can be done here. Select the correct microphone input and adjust the Voice Out and Voice In settings.\n\nVoice Activation: If enabled, you will automatically transmit if you go above the specified Voice Activation Level. Otherwise, you will have to press a key to transmit ("Y" key by default, but can be changed in the Global keymap options).
@HelpOptionColor=Color Options
@HelpOptionColorText=You can customize your chat colors. The channels each have a color value that you can pick.
@HelpOptionOther=Game Options
@HelpOptionOtherText=A few miscellaneous controls are listed here.\n\nAlways Run: If you toggle this option off, you will walk by default instead of run by default.\n\nShow Help-Star Training: If you turn this feature off, then you will no longer see the Help Stars over terminals, vehicles, etc. when you go into the game with a new character.\n\nChat Colors: Toggle the display of embedded chat colors.\n\nHide UI: Toggle the display of the user interface when taking screenshots.\n\nShow One Squad Per Line: Toggle to display each platoon's squad members on their own line.\n\n\Allow Squad List Overlap: Toggle to allow other UI windows to overlap the Squad/Platoon list.\n\nAuto Reload: Toggle to automatically reloads your weapon when it runs out of ammunition.\n\nSession Statistics: Toggles the display of your Session Statistics window.\n\nLFS Auto On: If you toggle this, your LFS flag will automatically be set on your character when they enter the world.\n\nEnable Map Edge Scroll: If selected, you can pan around the overhead map by positioning your mouse cursor near the edge of the map in the direction you want to pan. If not selected, you must click and drag to pan around the map.\n\nRender Names: Determine which names will appear over friendly soldiers and vehicles. Your choices are Player, Player and Outfit, and none. NOTE: You can also toggle through these states while in the world by hitting ALT+N repeatedly.\n\nBandwidth Settings: Adjust the settings according to your connection rate to optimize performance.\n\nProximity Radar Range Settings: These settings allow you to adjust how the radar will rotate, and customization of the Automatic Range feature. 
@HelpHUDView=HUD Elements
@HelpHUDViewText=In general, all the elements you see on your Heads-Up Display (HUD) are described in this chapter.
@HelpHUDAlarm=Alarm
@HelpHUDAlarmText=Typing /alarm into chat will bring up the alarm window. This window lets you set a reminder. When the timer expires, a window will show you the message you set. The reminder can be a certain number of hours and minutes or at a particular time. The alarm can be automatically set each time you start the game by selecting the "Autorestart" checkbox. If an alarm is already active, the status area will tell you when it is going to expire. To set the alarm, hit the "Set" button. To cancel an alarm, use the "Clear" button. 
@HelpHUDActiveItems=Holsters
@HelpHUDActiveItemsText=Any weapons that you have at your disposal are shown in the form of 'Holsters' in the bar at the bottom of your screen.\n\nYou can activate a Holster by tapping the appropriate number key (1-4).\n\nIf you are in individual armor (Infiltration, Standard, Agile, Reinforced or MAX), you are equipping an available weapon into your hand so that you can fire. In a vehicle, this 'holster' indicates the weapon you have at your vehicle position (if available).\n\nThe 'dots' next to the weapon indicate firing modes. The top dot is your Primary fire mode, the second one is your Secondary fire mode, etc.\n\nThe icon directly below your holster is the type of ammunition you currently have loaded into the weapon.\n\nThe number to the left of that ammo type icon is the number of shots you have left in your clip. (NOTE: This is also indicated by the filled area behind your weapon icon in the holster area just for a quick-glance representation.)\n\nThe number to the right of the ammo icon is how many shots of that type you have left in your *inventory* so that you know how many shots you have remaining.\n\nThe weapon you currently have equipped has a highlighted holster so you can easily see that information at a glance.
@HelpHUDAwardProgress=Achievements
@HelpHUDAwardProgressText=This area displays all the medals and honors you've accumulated in your career. (Remember that for purposes of accumulating medals, your career started when the Medals program began...not when your character was created. Everyone started out evenly at that time.)\n\nChoose your favorite three medals to display on your character in first-person view (on your Honor Gardbrace). Medals are easily chosen for display by simply left-clicking the medal you wish to display and then dropping that medal in the appropriate display slot. To remove a medal from a slot, simply right-click on it.\n\nOnly three medals may be chosen at any one time to display, so choose the ones you want to show off the most.\n\nYou may not display a single medal in more than one slot, and you may not display a Term of Service award in one of these slots. (Those are automatically displayed in a separate slot.)
@HelpHUDBFRTerminal=BFR Terminal
@HelpHUDBFRTerminalText=BFR Terminals are located in the BFR Bay in a facility's courtyard. To use the terminal, approach it and press your Action Key. You will then have a menu where you can select which BFR chassis you would like to purchase. You may customize your BFR by swapping out different weapons at any facility's Repair/Rearm Silo (no lattice link is needed for this function) and then save your configuration to the Favorites menu. Once you have done this, you may order Favorite configurations directly from the BFR Terminal.
@HelpHUDBugReport=Submitting Bug Reports
@HelpHUDBugReportText=To submit bug reports, simply type /bug in your chat pane. A dialog then appears allowing you to enter information specific to the bug. Please fill out all pertinent fields. The bug report won't allow you to send it if you don't enter all necessary information, so don't worry about leaving something out. Just be as clear and concise as possible, describing the bug AND what you were doing at the time the bug occurred, so that duplication of the issue internally is easier to accomplish...which gets the bug squashed faster.
@HelpHUDCertTerminal=Certification Terminal
@HelpHUDCertTerminalText=This terminal interfaces with your Empire's military records and programs the identichip embedded in your body to allow access to various vehicles, weapons, and equipment.\n\nWithout such programming, you will not be granted access to utilize that equipment.\n\nUse this terminal to spend Certification Points awarded by your Empire to unlock access to weapons, vehicles, equipment, and armors.
@HelpHUDChatOptions=Chat Options Window 
@HelpHUDChatOptionsText=This window can be viewed by clicking on the "Options" button in the chat pane.\n\nWhen you activate this pull-down screen, you see 'SEND' options on the left and 'RECEIVE' options on the right. Choose which chat channels you wish to hear/see by choosing one or more channels in the 'RECEIVE' menu. Choose which chat channel you are sending text in by choosing one (only one) 'SEND' option.
@HelpHUDCharacterPane=Character Info Window 
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneText=This section describes the Character window.
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneInfo=Info
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneInfoText=On this pane you'll see your soldier's name, battle rank, command rank, certification points remaining to be spent, current grief point totals, as well as the various certifications you possess.\n\nAdditionally, your current Implants are shown on this screen.\n\nImplant hotkeys are automatically created on your hotbar for any implants that require activation. Activate them by tapping the appropriate key (indicated on the hotkey itself).
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneTraining=Training
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneTrainingText=This area displays all the worlds and objects in the game. A checkmark next to the item means that you have viewed the item and its corresponding First Time Help text. The list can be sorted by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the pane.
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneTrainingMissions=Training Missions
@HelpHUDCharacterPaneTrainingMissionsText=This area displays all of the Training Missions. Missions listed in white are available for you to start, while dimmed items mean that there are prerequisites required before you can start that mission. Prerequisites are listed in the lower-right pane and the ones that are not met will be shown in red.
@HelpHUDCorpse=Death & Respawn
@HelpHUDCorpseText=When you are killed, your body collapses to the ground as a 'corpse'. Don't worry...it's a temporary situation.\n\nYou'll immediately see a progress bar that takes quite a while to elapse. If that bar gets all the way to the end, you will automatically respawn and appear at your Sanctuary.\n\nHowever, you can single-click on any of the respawn locations indicated on the Respawn Interface and, after a short wait, you'll respawn at that facility, whether it is a deployed AMS, Facility or Tower.\n\nIf you don't choose a respawn location, and your auto-timer hasn't expired, then Advanced Medics can Revive you on the spot. They will come to your corpse, use their medical applicator, and if you allow it, you can be Revived immediately without being transported to a respawn location. Handy, eh?
@HelpHUDCustomerService=Customer Service
@HelpHUDCustomerServiceText=Doing a /appeal in chat will open up the Customer Service window. This allows you to send a request to Customer Service. This request is put into a queue and the Customer Service Representatives get to your request as quickly as possible, first resolving any earlier requests before becoming able to fix the issue you're having.
@HelpHUDDamage=Damage Indicators
@HelpHUDDamageText=The area around your crosshairs (reticule) flashes red whenever you take damage.\n\nThe red arcs you see indicate the direction the attack is coming from, so if you watch those indicators, you can quickly turn to face your attacker and return fire.\n\nConversely, when you hit a target, your reticule will show a small yellow disc to let you know that your bullet impacted.\n\nIf the target you select is out of range, the reticule will turn yellow to show that fact, turning red (to indicate 'enemy acquired') only when your weapon can actually hit your opponent at that range.
@HelpHUDEquipment=Equipment Terminal
@HelpHUDEquipmentText=The Equipment Terminal is your key to all personal, whether it's armor, weaponry, ammo, or any of the miscellaneous items needed for hacking, engineering, medical purposes or even command. Vehicles and Implants cannot be acquired at an Equipment Terminal.\n\nYou will only see items on these lists for which you have certifications. If you are not certified to use an item, then you will not see it in this terminal. The exceptions to that rule are vehicle ammo (which anyone can grab if they want to take it to a vehicle) and the Command Uplink device, which can only be acquired by Commanders of at least Rank 2.\n\nTo acquire an item, just double-click it and it will be placed in your inventory in any empty space available. If no empty space exists, then the item will be attached to your mouse cursor for you to drop or destroy.\n\nThe right-most tab is the FAVORITES listing. This is how you can save inventory configurations for easy future access (rather than having to select and place all those items every time). Once you get your inventory in the shape you desire, just double-click an empty line on this interface, fill in a name for the Favorite, and hit SAVE. When you return to an equipment terminal later, you can easily double-click on this favorite (or hit the corresponding number key) and it will be auto-acquired for you. This saves you a lot of button clicking when getting inventory during a battle, so it is HIGHLY recommended that you set up your favorites ahead of time.
@HelpHUDExclamation=Help-Star Training
@HelpHUDExclamationText=When you first encounter something that is useful in the game (weapon, vehicle, terminal, capture console, generator, etc.), you will often see a three-pointed Auraxis symbol floating over the top of it.\n\nThis indicates that there is special 'help' information available there.\n\nIf you approach the object, and look straight at it, a dialog box will appear with information on how to use that item. (In the case of weapons, it comes up when you equip them.)\n\nTake a few moments to read these dialogs. They contain a great deal of information about how to use each item and will help you shorten your learning curve so you can just enjoy the game.\n\nAdditionally, the first-time help dialogs all come with an experience bonus as an incentive to activate them and learn about the game. 
@HelpHUDFriends=Friends Monitor
@HelpHUDFriendsText=The friends monitor lets you check the status of your friends.
@HelpHUDHUDItems=HUD Items
@HelpHUDHUDItemsText=The Heads Up Display contains crucial information to your survival. Becoming familiar with each of these elements will help you stay alive longer in battle, and organize with other players.
@HelpHUDImplant=Implant Terminal
@HelpHUDImplantText=You receive available Implant slots at Battle Ranks 6, 12, and 18.\n\nThe only place you can fill those slots, however, is at an Implant Terminal. These terminals are available only at Bio Labs and the Sanctuary.\n\nTo use an Implant Terminal, just step onto the mount circle and press 'G' to enter the terminal.\n\nYou'll then see a screen allowing you to browse through the Implants, getting information on each of them. You can easily add or remove implants via this interface.\n\nNOTE: When you first install an Implant, it has an activation timer that must expire before the Implant will function.\n\nYour Implant's activation timer must also expire after each time you die, so be warned that you are slightly less capable immediately after death because of this.
@HelpHUDInventory=Inventory
@HelpHUDInventoryText=The Inventory pane is fairly self-explanatory, but some quick notes are appropriate.\n\nYou can left-click an object to pick it up, and then left-click elsewhere to drop it.\n\nTo destroy an object, pick it up and then place it on the 'Destroy' button at the bottom of the pane.\n\nYou can drop an object to the ground by clicking the object and placing it on the 'Drop' button.\n\nIf you are configuring Favorites, or just want to quickly clean out your inventory, then the 'Clear All' button can be very useful. Using this button will empty out all inventory from both the grid and all available holsters. You can then easily start from scratch acquiring equipment from a terminal or looting it from another player.\n\nThere is a 'Use Item' button, but it is mostly included for completeness. You can use an item by selecting it and then moving it to this button, or you can do it by right-clicking the object (which uses it immediately).\n\nThe easiest way to use a medkit, however, is to tap the appropriate F-key to activate the hotkey that is automatically created the first time you put a medkit in your inventory.\n\nFor ease-of-use, you can right-click any item in your inventory that can be holstered and it will automatically swap into one of your pistol or rifle slots (as appropriate).\n\nAlso, you can right-click any object in your inventory to move it quickly to a locker, trunk, or to take something from a loot box.
@HelpHUDLocker=Lockers
@HelpHUDLockerText=Lockers are often critical when the generator is destroyed in your facility and all the equipment terminals lose power.\n\nLockers initially start completely empty. The only way they gain items is if you put them there.\n\nItems stored in Lockers are available at ANY lockers as long as the building housing the lockers is controlled by your Empire.\n\nLockers are persistent and the items placed there will be available each time you log in.\n\nNote: You can hack Lockers in enemy installations for quick access to your stored equipment.
@HelpHUDMisc=Miscellaneous Windows
@HelpHUDMiscText=Information about other windows in the game.
@HelpHUDOutfit=Outfit Info Window
@HelpHUDOutfitText=The Outfit Info window can be accessed from the Game Windows button on the status bar.\n\nOutfits are permanent organizations that allow you and your comrades-in-arms to group together, communicate more easily, and to accrue fame and glory for yourselves.\n\nTo start an Outfit, you must have a full squad (10 players) who are not currently already in an Outfit. Once this occurs, the squad leader can click the 'Outfit' button and create the new organization.\n\nOnce an Outfit is created, all experience earned by Outfit members will create Outfit Points that will be used for future feature releases, as well as to create standings versus other Outfits in the game (see www.myplanetside.com for Outfit standings). Outfit points are only a fractional percentage of any experience gained in the field (and they do *not* diminish experience gained...they are created out of nothing based on the experience earned by each Outfit member).\n\nOutfit members do not bring old experience to the table when they join an Outfit. Outfit Points are only generated by members while they are current members of an Outfit.\n\nAdditionally, soldiers in an Outfit can communicate with all members, anywhere in the world, by using their Outfit channel. (/o is the shortcut for chat.)\n\nAn Outfit needs at least 10,000 Outfit Points in order to be able to select and wear an Outfit insignia on their uniforms and vehicles.
@HelpHUDOutfitList=Outfit Listings
@HelpHUDOutfitListText=The Outfit Listings window displays a list of all outfits for your empire, the number of members, and number of outfit points.\n\nMore information on all outfits (including other empires) can be found on myplanetside.com
@HelpHUDPlayerPane=Players Window
@HelpHUDPlayerPaneText=The Players window can be accessed from the Game Windows button on the status bar.\n\nThis window lets you manage your squad, look for squad members (or look for a squad invitation if you're not forming a squad), as well as letting you manage your Friends list.\n\nThe leftmost tab is your Squad Management pane (labeled 'Squad'). It shows you all squad members, allows you to promote one of them to become squad leader, kick players out of the squad, and even leave the squad yourself.\n\nThe middle tab is your Friends List. Shown here is a complete list of your friends, as well as their on-line status. You can add, delete, or even open a mini-window that shows your friends and on-line status at a glance.\n\nThe right-most tab is the 'Find Squad' (Looking for Squad) pane. To indicate that you're looking for a squad, just click the LFS (Looking for Squad) button and folks will start to see you as available.\n\nIf you're a squad leader, you can advertise that you *need* people, or certain certifications, by clicking the LFS button.\n\nWhether you're looking for a squad or trying to fill one up, you can be very specific about what certifications you're advertising as available or looking to get into your squad.
@HelpHUDRadar=Proximity Map
@HelpHUDRadarText=This 'mini-map' allows you to see the area around you at a glance as you move through the world.\n\nThe map can be zoomed to three different levels, from 50m diameter to 200m diameter. (Default keys for changing zoom levels are '[' and ']'.) It will also show the interiors of buildings once you enter them for ease of navigation.\n\nCompass directions are shown for visual reference and your radar imaging will pick up enemy vehicles and show their icons there as well.\n\nSquadmates are indicated by number on the map, if they're close enough, and other friendlies are represented by dots.\n\nNOTE: If it's a red icon of any type...it's an enemy. Beware.
@HelpHUDReticle=Weapon Reticule
@HelpHUDReticleText=Your weapon's reticule gives you several pieces of critical information.\n\nThe first and foremost is that it shows you your Cone of Fire (CoF). As you fire your weapons, or take damage, or move rapidly, your CoF will expand. A large CoF is an inaccurate CoF, so you want to keep it as small as possible.\n\nTo understand how a CoF works, just imagine a cone that projects outward from your muzzle toward the horizon. The reticule outlines the current 'base' of that cone. So therefore, the wider that base is, the larger the potential impact area is as the bullets trace a line between your weapon's muzzle (the tip of the cone) and a random point somewhere on the base of the cone.\n\nAdditionally, when you hit a target with bullets, your reticule will 'pulse' letting you know that you've hit that target.\n\nLastly, the reticule shows you whether you're in-range of a target. If you center your reticule on a target, the reticule will turn more yellow if the target is out of range, red if it's in range and the target is an enemy or green if the target is in range, but a friendly.
@HelpHUDShortcuts=Shortcut Bar
@HelpHUDShortcutsText=This shortcut bar is setup to allow you to easily activate/deactivate your implants, quickly use medkits, and to hang text macro icons once you create them.\n\nImplant and medkit shortcuts are created automatically when you have those items, but text macros have to be created manually.\n\nTo create a text macro, type /macro in your chat pane, followed by a three-letter descriptor tag, and then the actual chat command you want to execute.\n\nFor instance: /macro RAL /squad Retreat! Fall back to Squad Waypoint One!\n\nThe macro above would create a square icon with the letters "RAL" (short for RALLY) on it. You'd place that icon in your hotbar and then, when the appropriate F-key is pressed, the text macro will go off. In this case, the macro would result in a squad chat sentence saying "Retreat! Fall back to Squad Waypoint One!" and could be used to quickly order a retreat.
@HelpHUDSquad=Squad Bar
@HelpHUDSquadText=A squad is composed of up to 10 other players. The chief advantages of being in a squad are a) shared experience and b) communication and command.\n\nAll squad members share all experience gained by other squad members as long as you are on the same continent as those other squad members. Squad members will receive a bonus to their share of EXP obtained from overcoming enemies if they are in close proximity of the Blue Diamond Squad EXP Waypoint. \n\nIn addition to the experience sharing, squads can use the /squad chat channel (or /s) to speak to one another easily without others overhearing. You can also use ALT+# to give a quick /tell to another Squadmate.\n\nThere are also Command features that allow easier communications with Squadmates.\n\nYou will find, after playing a bit, that squads are the easiest way to earn experience and that being involved in a squad is some of the best gaming you can get. Enjoy!

From left to right it includes the time spent in this play session, K/D refers to your number of enemy Kills scored while the /D tallies the number of times you have died in this session. Depending on support activities you have performed (healing, repairing, hacking, utilizing support vehicles, etc.) you may have a "A:" listing on the Session Statistics Bar. This indicates the number of "Assist" kills you have been awarded. Assist kills can also tally if you are piloting a vehicle and gunners of yours score kills. If you want to see details about what kills you are scoring (assist or normal) open your Character Information HUD (default is "O") and click the Stats button at the bottom and review your statistics. \n\nThe remainder of the Bar includes counters for BEP (Battle Experience), CEP (Command Experience) and, if you have engaged in support activities that have gained you experience, SEP (Battle experience that came in through support activities).
@HelpHUDStatus=Soldier Status
@HelpHUDStatusText=A soldier has three main statistics: Health, Armor, and Stamina.\n\nHealth is self-explanatory, but when you reach zero in this category, you are dead.\n\nArmor equates to the amount of protection you gain when wearing any particular armored suit. Infiltration suits have the least (with no armor at all), while MAX units have the most (at 650 armor).\n\nStamina is used when powering Implants. You also lose Stamina as a byproduct of taking damage. The more damage you take, the bigger the Stamina hit is.
@HelpHUDStatistics=Statistics Window
@HelpHUDStatisticsText=This window can be accessed by opening your Character Info window nd the clicking on the "Stats" button on the bottom.\n\nAll your soldier's personal statistics are tracked here. Information in these panes is shown in 2 columns -- the first column is a tally of the stat during your career, and the second column is a tally of the stat during the current session.
@HelpHUDStatisticsKills=Kills
@HelpHUDStatisticsKillsText=This pane displays the number of kill types you have made.
@HelpHUDStatisticsAssists=Assists
@HelpHUDStatisticsAssistsText=This pane displays the number of assists you have made.

@HelpHUDTradeText=By getting close to another soldier and hitting "G" to interact with that player, you can access the 'Trade' function.\n\nWith this feature, you can securely trade items to other players without having to drop the item on the ground and having the other player pick it up.\n\nTo use the interface, first place the item to be traded into your side of the window, and then click the TRADE button.\n\nOnce the other player finalizes the trade by clicking his CONFIRM button, the trade is accomplished and the item swaps to that other player's inventory.\n\nNOTE: The other player must have room for the items in his inventory or the trade will be cancelled and you will retain possession of the items.
@HelpHUDTrunk=Trunk
@HelpHUDTrunkText=Each vehicle has a trunk. That trunk is where all ammunition for the vehicle is stored, and there is some extra room in there for carrying other miscellaneous items (like a nano-dispenser to repair your vehicle with, or some personal ammo).\n\nYou can lock your trunk so that other players can't access it in your Vehicle Permissions window, accessed from the Soldier Management Menu.
@HelpHUDVehicle=Vehicle Terminal
@HelpHUDVehicleText=You can acquire Vehicles from this type of terminal. The type of vehicles available is dependent on two things: a) Whether you're certified in a vehicle or not, and b) Which type of vehicle terminal you are accessing.\n\nThe vehicle terminal will only show you vehicle options for which you are certified.\n\nAdditionally, there are Ground Vehicle terminals and Air Vehicle terminals. Different facilities have different types of vehicles available, although all facilities have a Ground Vehicle Terminal. NOTE: Only Sanctuaries and Dropship Centers give you access to the Galaxy Dropship.\n\nThe last thing to consider is that whether your Empire owns a Technology Plant on the continent you're standing on will determine whether or not "Advanced" vehicles are available at the vehicle terminal or not. Most of the heavier vehicles (like heavy tanks, Sunderer variants, Reaver, and the heavy buggies) will not be available unless your Empire owns a Technology Plant.
@HelpHUDVehicleAccess=Vehicle Access Window
@HelpHUDVehicleAccessText=Like all windows, this can be accessed from the Game Windows button on the status bar.\n\nThis window allows you to do several things: 1) Kick people from your vehicle and 2) Set Access permissions for each of the vehicle positions.\n\nTo kick a player from your vehicle, select their name from the list and click on the Kick button.\n\nTo set permissions on a position, select it from the Access Type dropdown and select the desired Access Level from the list below. You can set permissions on the following positions: Driver, Gunner, Passenger, Trunk, and All.\n\nThere are 3 different Access Levels you can set for each position.

@HelpMapView=Map
@HelpMapViewText=This section describes how to use the various Map features.
@HelpMapGlobal=Interstellar View
@HelpMapGlobalText=This map is critical to your awareness of the warfare going on across the various planets, moons, and asteroids connected by the Auraxian Warpgate system.\n\nThe Interstellar View shows the destination stars you can reach via the Warpgate system. By clicking on either a star, or that star's planetary pane (the boxes on the right, left and top), you can easily see the links between your selected star and its destinations. The links are color-coded so that you can easily distinguish which Warpgate on your chosen planet goes to which Warpgate on your destination planet.\n\nThe various planets are on the left and right of the screen. Double-clicking either the star, or its planetary pane, takes you to a closer view of that location.\n\nAlong the top of the screen are four of the six caverns. Two of them are currently active, while the other two are inactive, but "on deck" until their turn arrives. A timer is shown over the "on deck" caverns so you know how long until they cycle to active status.\n\nGeowarps on the continents are shown by a green triangle, but it's easiest to see which continent has a link to a cavern by simply clicking on that cavern's pane and seeing where it's linked to currently.\n\nAlong the top of the screen (in the title bar) there are "action" buttons that let you toggle information on/off, let you see the map legend (so you can understand the icons more easily), or perform tasks like setting waypoints (and changing your view between map levels). If you're a commander, then your Battleplans are also accessed in this area.\n\nSome planets have multiple islands on a single world. These are called "clusters". (The Oshur Cluster is one such example.) When you double-click on a cluster, you go to a Cluster View, rather than directly to the Planetary View. This Cluster View allows you to see the intra-cluster lattice links and get a tactical overview of the Cluster before zooming in further. Double-click any of the islands in the Cluster view to move to its Planetary View.\n\nNOTE: If a continent is Empire Locked, it appear a solid color in either red, blue, or purple in the planet pane. If a continent is Population Locked, a lock icon will appear in the corner of the planet pane.
@HelpMapContinent=Planetary View
@HelpMapContinentText=The planetary view is where you'll get most of the information you need for close tactical decisions.\n\nYou can easily zoom in and out of the map by either using your mouse wheel, or the zoom in/out buttons.\n\nMost features on the map can be toggled on/off by either clicking on the option in the Display list, or using the corresponding hotkey.\n\nTo understand other features on the map, pull down the 'Map Legends' drop box (from the top of the screen).
@HelpMapDroppod=Drop Pod Map
@HelpMapDroppodText=This interface is shown after you board the HART and ascend to the stratosphere.\n\nThe image looks like the Interstellar View, but is used to decide your drop zone location.\n\nTo do this, first double-click on a planet pane or planet icon. Once you get to the planetary view, you can single-click anywhere on the map to designate a drop zone.\n\nOnce you've selected a drop zone, just hit the 'Launch Drop Pod' button to leave this interface and streak to the chosen location below.
@HelpEquipment=Equipment
@HelpEquipmentText=This section describes the various support equipment you can use, such as REKs, Medical Applicators and more. 
@HelpStaticObjects=Facility Objects 
@HelpStaticObjectsText=This section includes descriptions of the various objects in various facilities.
@HelpWorldObjects=World Objects
@HelpWorldObjectsText=This section includes descriptions of various objects in the world.
@HelpExperience=Experience
@HelpExperienceText=As you perform duties and fight for your Empire, you will be awarded experience points as a representation of your progress. These experience points go toward advancing your Battle Rank or Command Rank, depending on the activities they are awarded for. People may also refer to Support Experience, but this is simply Battle Experience gained through performing Support activities rather than direct combat.
@HelpBattleExperience=Battle Experience
@HelpBattleExperienceText=The experience you are awarded for the majority of activities will count toward your Battle Rank, and is therefore called Battle Experience. Open your Character Information Display (default is "O") and you can view your progress toward your next battle rank. Each of the 10 blocks must be filled in to advance in rank. The thin bar under the 10 blocks represents your progress through the current block you are filling in.  
@HelpCommandExperience=Command Experience
@HelpCommandExperienceText=Command Experience can only be gained while you are the leader of a Squad and you or your squad members participate in the successful capture of a base. At the time the base capture goes through, you will be awarded Command Experience based on the size of your squad (larger squads typically receive more), the enemy resistance to the capture, the time spent in the Sphere of Influence of the base and other factors.
@HelpSupportExperience=Support Experience
@HelpSupportExperienceText=Support Experience is not a different bar to fill in to lead to new ranks. All experience gained through support activities will count toward your advancement of Battle Rank and is therefore a subset of Battle Experience. There are a number of activities that can lead to gaining experience not directly related to scoring enemy kills.  These include, healing or repairing friendly soldiers and equipment, placing AMS units, hacking enemy systems that are then used by friendlies, successfully dropping troops via the Galaxy, placing Routers or Router Telepads and providing support via the LodeStar support vehicle. \n\nWhen friendly soldiers you have supported through these activities go on to score enemy kills, you will receive "assist" kills (denoted by numbers after the A: on the Session Statistics Bar) and an extra percentage of the experience the kill was worth.  The size of the percentage depends on how much support you rendered to the soldier scoring the kill.
@HelpSquads=Squads
@HelpSquadsText=A squad is composed of up to 10 other players. The chief advantages of being in a squad are a) shared experience and b) communication and command.\n\nAll squad members share all experience gained by other squad members as long as you are on the same continent as those other squad members. Squad members will receive a bonus to their share of EXP obtained from overcoming enemies if they are in close proximity of the Blue Diamond Squad EXP Waypoint. \n\nIn addition to the experience sharing, squads can use the /squad chat channel (or /s) to speak to one another easily without others overhearing. You can also use ALT+# to give a quick /tell to another Squadmate.\n\nThere are also Command features that allow easier communications with Squadmates.\n\nYou will find, after playing a bit, that squads are the easiest way to earn experience and that being involved in a squad is some of the best gaming you can get. Enjoy!
@HelpSquadJoin=Join
@HelpSquadJoinText=To join a squad, you must first be invited by that squad's leader.\n\nOnce he invites you, a dialog will appear asking you whether you want to join the squad or not. Just click 'YES' to join the squad.\n\nOnce you've joined the squad, you may be invited to an existing voice conference if one is available.
@HelpSquadCreate=Create
@HelpSquadCreateText=To create a squad, you simply have to invite another player to join your squad. Once that player agrees to join, your squad is formed and you're the squad's leader.\n\nTo invite another player, just type /invite <player name>\n\nThere are various options available to you now.

@HelpSquadLeave=Leave
@HelpSquadLeaveText=To leave a squad, hit 'P' to open the Squad window, and then click on the "Squad" tab. This shows your squad listing.\n\nAt that point, just click the 'LEAVE' button and you will remove yourself from the squad.
@HelpSquadCommands=Commands
@HelpSquadCommandsText=As a CR2 Commander, you can give Directed Voice Macros to your squadmates.\n\nTo do this, left-mouse click the Squadmate, and then use a 'V' menu voice macro to give a command.\n\nFor instance, click your Squadmate 'Avenger' and type VAC. Avenger will then receive the following chat message: 'Squad Command: Hack the Control Console!'.\n\nIn this way, you can give quick commands without tying your fingers up typing. The message goes *only* to the intended recipients (you can select multiple Squadmates to give a command to) so it can be more focused and useful than just using Voice chat.
@HelpSquadHomeBase=Squad Home Base
@HelpSquadHomeBaseText=Any Squad Leader can assign a friendly facility to act as a home base for their squad.  This functionality allows for squad members to easily set their bind to this base.  Once the squad is bound there, the Squad Leader can order the Squad to rematrix back to their Home Base, making it an ideal gathering area to stage attacks from, mount defense of the base or to gather the squad for transport to other regions.
@HelpSquadHomeBaseSquadMembers=Squad Members
@HelpSquadHomeBaseSquadMembersText=As the member of a squad, your leader may assign a base as the home for your squad. When this happens, you will receive notification and a green "H" waypoint on your overhead radar display, pointing to the base. \n\nWhen you enter the sphere of influence of your squad's home base, you will receive a pop up asking if you wish to bind your matrix data to the base. Your Squad Leader will be able to rematrix the entire squad to the base to coordinate attacks, stage for base defense or to gather for transport to another region. \n\nYou can view each of your squad and platoon members bind locations and if they are bound to their squad's home base from the squad listing.
@HelpSquadHomeBaseSquadLeaders=Squad Leaders
@HelpSquadHomeBaseSquadLeadersText=As the leader of a squad, you can use the a base's main terminal, located in control area of most bases, to set a friendly facility as the home base for your squad. When this is done, you will bind your matrix data to the base and any squad members who enter the base's SOI will be asked to bind. You can view squad binds from the squad list. \n\nYou can issue an order to recall squad members bound to the home base back to it, allowing you to gather your squad more effectively. You can also recall your squad to the sanctuary and squad members will all show up at the respawn facility nearest to your location. \n\n If you are in a platoon, orders issued by the platoon leader will lock out your commands for 60 seconds while they resolve and vice versa where your commands will lock out the platoon leader while they resolve. \n\nIf you are CR2 or above and have access to the CUD you can issue recall commands via this device.
@HelpSquadHomeBasePlatoonLeaders=Platoon Leaders
@HelpSquadHomeBasePlatoonLeadersText=In addition to squad commands available at base Main Terminals (see the Squad Leaders section), platoon leaders have versions of Home Base commands that will affect all squads in the platoon. \n\nTo avoid conflicts, orders issued by squad leaders in the platoon will lock out your commands for 60 seconds while they resolve and your platoon commands will lock out the squad leader capabilities while they resolve. If you are CR2 or above and have access to the CUD you can issue platoon recall commands via this device.
@HelpPlatoon=Platoon
@HelpPlatoonText=A platoon is composed of up to 3 squads. The chief advantages of being in a platoon are communication and command.\n\nPlatoons can use the /platoon chat channel (or /p) to speak to one another easily without others overhearing. You can also use double click on the member name to give a quick /tell to another platoon member.\n\nThere are also Command features that allow easier communications with platoon members.
@HelpPlatoonJoin=Join

@HelpOutfits=Outfits 
@HelpOutfitsText=Outfits are permanent and potentially large organizational structures. Like Squads, only with permanent members, Outfits have a special chat channel they can access but can also accommodate literally hundreds of players.\n\nThere are also organizational capabilities within the Outfit and statistics are kept for the Outfit itself, as well as its members for comparison purposes against other Outfits.
@HelpOutfitJoin=Join
@HelpOutfitJoinText=To join an Outfit, you must either be there when it's created, or you must receive an invitation from an Officer of that Outfit.\n\nTo gain an invitation, speak with Outfit members, get to know them, battle alongside them on occasion, and then ask for an invite. It's not guaranteed that this process will work, but it's the likeliest avenue to getting such an invitation.
@HelpOutfitCreate=Create
@HelpOutfitCreateText=To form an Outfit, you must first form a squad with 10 players in it. All 10 players must not belong to any other Outfit. If both of those conditions are valid, then you simply click the "Create Outfit" button and your Outfit is instantly created. Choose a name for your Outfit, and you're good to go.\n\nOnce your outfit earns 10,000 outfit poitns, the outfit leader will be able to choose a logo for your outfit.

Click on it to advertise you are looking for a squad to join, or use it as a squad leader to advertise for squad members.
@HelpChatChannels=Channels
@HelpChatChannelsText=There are seven chat channels you can access. They are: Local, Squad, Platoon Outfit, Command, Broadcast, and if you are a Squad Leader, you can talk on Squad Command.\n\nLocal chat is 'open' chat. Everything you say is heard by friendly units in your immediate area. This is the most common way to chat with folks outside your squad.\n\nSquad chat is heard only by other squad members. It's reliable communication during combat.\n\nSquad chat is heard only by other Platoon members. Players may still use the Squad channel to send messages only to their squad instead of the entire platoon.\n\nOutfit chat is exactly like Squad chat, except that it sends to a potentially larger group...your Outfit.\n\nCommand chat can only be accessed by Commanders of CR3 or better. This is a global channel that allows Commanders to speak directly with one another and increases coordination of the Empires.\n\nSquad Leader Command chat allows all Squad Leaders on a particular planet to communicate with every other Squad Leader on that planet.\n\nFinally, but very importantly, Broadcast chat allows all friendly units to speak with any other friendly units within the area of any non-enemy SOI. Therefore, you can easily chat with soldiers of your same Empire around any facilities except those held by your enemies.\n\nEach chat channel has a shortcut to prevent you from having to change chat channels via the SEND menu all the time. Those shortcuts are:\n/l Local\n/s Squad\n/pPlatoon\n/o Outfit\n/b Broadcast\n/c Command\n/sl Squad Leader
@HelpChatFilters=Filters
@HelpChatFiltersText=You can easily define which chat channels you want to listen to by accessing the 'RECEIVE' pull-down menu on your chat pane.\n\nUn-click any chat channel you don't wish to listen to and that chat will cease to appear in your chat pane.
@HelpChatMacros=Macros
@HelpChatMacrosText=Voice macros are used as a quick substitute for extensive typing for commonly used phrases in the game.\n\nMost chat macros are mnemonic, meaning that the first letter of each step stands for what the option on the menu that starts with that letter.\n\nExample: VVA = Voice + Very Quick + Anytime! = Your character saying "Anytime!" Another example is VAM = Voice + Attack + Medical Terminal = Your character saying "Attack their Medical Terminal!"\n\nThe categories make quick sense if you spend a few moments investigating the sub-menus. A = Attack, D = Defense, R = Repair, and so on.\n\nThus, with just a few keystrokes, you can quickly whip off standard commands and acknowledgements.\n\nDon't forget that you can use text macros to supplement your voice macro menus. (See Shortcuts help for more info on text macros.)
@HelpChatCommands=Chat Commands
@HelpChatCommandsText=PlanetSide offers a range of shortcuts and commands available in chat. To access the commands, you enter them into the chat area. Typing '/' will open the chat window with the command already started.
@HelpChatCommandsChat=Communication

When this is the case, the Next and Previous buttons will appear.

# FAQ (aka Field Manual) Strings
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@FAQHowToGetToBattle=\\#00FF00How do I get to a battle?\\#FFFFFF\nInstant Action teleports you to a hot area, and is the quickest way to combat.  To use it, press Esc to open the Game Menu, then select Instant Action.\n\nAnother option is to take the HART shuttle from your empire's sanctuary.  From the shuttle you can drop onto any continent that is not locked by the enemy.  Shuttles leave every five minutes.\n\nOr, you can drive a vehicle through a warpgate. This is often strategically useful, but can be the slowest method for getting into combat, especially for ground vehicles.

@FAQHowToUseWeapons=\\#00FF00How do I use weapons?\\#FFFFFF\nPress keys 1 through 5 to draw your weapons. Your weapons and ammo are shown on the status bar. To holster a drawn weapon, press its number again.  Hint:  You run faster when you have no weapons drawn!

@FAQHowToGetVehicles=\\#00FF00How do I get a vehicle?\\#FFFFFF\nYou can acquire vehicles from the vehicle terminals in facilities and your empire's sanctuary.  However, you may only acquire vehicles you are certified to use.

@FAQHowToGetMoreGear=\\#00FF00How do I get certified for weapons and vehicles?\\#FFFFFF\nAs your character earns experience and goes up in Battle Rank, you will be awarded Certification Points that can be spent at Certification Terminals, located in biolabs and your empire's sanctuary.  These points can be spent to unlock access to weapons, vehicles, and specialist equipment.

@FAQWhatIsVirtualTraining=\\#00FF00What is Virtual Training?\\#FFFFFF\nVirtual training allows you to try every weapon and vehicle available to your empire, even if you aren't certified for them. The Virtual Training center can be found in your sanctuary, at the rear of the Respawn buildings.\n\nNote: You can get to Battle Rank 4 simply by trying out every weapon and vehicle in VR Training!

@FAQHowToCaptureEnemyTowers=\\#00FF00How do I capture enemy towers?\\#FFFFFF\nTo capture an enemy tower, equip a REK (handheld hacking device) and hack the tower's control console.  When the hack completes, the tower is yours!\n\nAs you'll soon discover, hacking takes a long time if you don't have the Hacking or Advanced Hacking certifications.  If you plan to make a career as a hacker, you'll want to learn those certs.

@FAQHowToCaptureEnemyFacilities=\\#00FF00How do I capture enemy facilities?\\#FFFFFF\nThe first step to capturing an enemy facility is to locate and hack its Control Console.  Once hacked, you must successfully defend the hack for fifteen minutes to complete the capture.\n\nNote that some bases spawn Logic Lattic Units (LLUs) when hacked.  To capture these facilities you must take the LLU to the control console of a nearby friendly facility within fifteen minutes.  LLU facilities are usually much faster to capture than hack-n-hold ones.

@FAQHowToResecure=\\#00FF00My facility has been hacked! What do I do?\\#FFFFFF\nTo resecure a facility that has been hacked, you simply need to rehack the control console before the capture goes through. Of course, the enemy will probably be defending the console, so expect resistance.

@FAQHowToGetImplants=\\#00FF00How do I get implants?\\#FFFFFF\nAt Battle Ranks 6, 12, and 18 you will receive a new implant slot.  To install an implant, use an Implant Terminal, located in Biolabs and your sanctuary. Unlike certifications, implants have no waiting period between changes, so feel free to experiment.

@FAQHowToEarnCR=\\#00FF00How do I earn command rank?\\#FFFFFF\nPlayers gain command experience (CEP) by leading squads that capture enemy facilities or resecure friendly facilities that have been hacked.\n\nAs you rise in Command Rank, you gain special abilities, like enhanced intel capabilities, and the awesome Orbital Strike.

@FAQHowToSquad=\\#00FF00How do I join or create a squad?\\#FFFFFF\nThe fastest way to join a squad is to open the Players window and look at the Find Squad tab.  This will show you squads that are currently looking for members.\n\nTo start your own squad, invite another player by typing "/invite {playername}". If they accept your invitation, the squad is formed, and you can start earning Command Experience!

@FAQWhatIsLFS=\\#00FF00What is LFS?\\#FFFFFF\nLFS is shorthand for "Looking For Squad". Players who are LFS have "Looking For Squad" over their heads.  You can set your LFS state by clicking the LFS toggle on the status bar.

@Event311_Statement_Subject=Communication from the Core
@Event311_Statement=Attention, empire.\n\nThe recent communication from the Core is being deciphered.  Additional intel will follow.  However, there is nothing to report at this time.  Keep in mind that the message may have been a distraction to the other empires, so equip yourself and take advantage of this opportunity to beat down your enemy.
@Event311_StartCountdown_Subject=Potential security breach
@Event311_StartCountdown=Attention, empire.\n\nRecent activity has led us to discover that the Core is decrypting code at this moment, and will complete within 90 minutes.\n\nBe on alert.

@Event311_Status_Pregame_Subject=Briefing: Environmental Changes
@Event311_Status_Pregame=Attention, empire.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, there has been an unusually high level of seismic activity lately.  The cause is unclear, but the situation is being monitored closely.\n\nAdditional information will follow as it becomes available.
@Event311_Status_Deprivation_Subject=Briefing: Replication Procedure Corruption
@Event311_Status_Deprivation=Attention, empire.\n\nThe Core has breached our central mainframe and has rewritten vital portions of our replication procedures.\n\nThe reasons for this attack --if it is an attack --are unclear.\n\nOur engineers are trying to get the situation under control, but for the moment the Core's reprogramming has interfered with our ability to reconstruct some vehicle matrices.\n\nFortunately, it appears that our enemies are suffering the same disruption, so while we are without some tools on the battlefield, we should not be at a disadvantage.\n\nFurther information will be released as it becomes available.
@Event311_Status_Acquisition_Subject=Briefing: Vehicle Restoration
@Event311_Status_Acquisition=Attention, empire.\n\nOur engineers have deduced how the Core breached our central mainframe, and have strengthened our security protocols to prevent further intrusions. With that acheived, we must now focus on restoring our ability to construct vehicle matrices --as our enemies are no doubt doing.\n\nProducing new stockpiles of clean nanites will take a long time, during which the empire could be at a severe military disadvantage.  However, our engineers believe that with direct access to the AT computer systems in the Caverns, they can decipher the Core's modifications to our replication procedures, and undo the programming done to them.\n\nIf successful, we may be able to regain our vehicles more quickly than the other empires.  So gather troops and assemble in the caverns as soon as possible. We need to monopolize each and every base to gain advantage over the other empires!
@Event311_Status_Postgame_Subject=Debriefing: Vehicle Restoration Complete
@Event311_Status_Postgame=Attention, empire.\n\nAfter several days of seismic and atmospheric anomalies, our central mainframe was repeatedly breached by the Core AI, who corrupted our vehicle replication procedures for reasons that remain unknown.  This left us with vastly diminished military capabilities, though fortunately our enemies were similarly impaired.\n\nAfter several days, our engineers were finally able to secure the mainframe against further intrusions, and reasoned that with dedicated access to the Ancient Tech computer systems in the Caverns they would be able to decipher and undo the Core's changes.\n\nThe brave soldiers of our empire performed admirably, securing bases in the Caverns against heavy opposition, and our engineers got the data they needed.  The empire's original replication procedures were fully restored.\n\nThanks to your efforts, our military is back to full operational capacity.  Well done, soldiers!

@Event311_Countdown_90=\\#FFFF0090 minutes remaining until security breach.
@EVent311_Countdown_60=\\#FFFF0060 minutes remaining until security breach.
@Event311_Countdown_30=\\#FFFF0030 minutes remaining until security breach.
@Event311_Countdown_20=\\#FFFF0020 minutes remaining until security breach.
@Event311_Countdown_15=\\#FFFF0015 minutes remaining until security breach.
@Event311_Countdown_Subject=Recurrence of security breach appears imminent
@Event311_Countdown=Despite our engineers' best efforts, the Auraxian Core has gained access to our secure mainframe and is once again rewriting vital portions of our replication procedures.\n\nIt seems logical to expect that disruptions similar to the ones we experienced yesterday will commence in approximately 90 minutes.

@Event311_Day1WrapUp_Subject=Damage Report
@Event311_Day1WrapUp=The Core's reprogramming has interfered with our ability to construct several vehicle matrices.  We have changed our security protocols, and believe we have stopped the Core from any further intrusions today. However, it comes at the loss of our heaviest assault vehicles. Fortunately, it appears that our enemies have been equally affected.
@Event311_Day2WrapUp_Subject=Damage Report
@Event311_Day2WrapUp=As we feared, the Core continued its assault on our systems, further disabling our ability to construct vehicles.  We believe we have stopped the Core from further corruption today, and do not expect any further attacks. Losing our bombers and reavers will certainly force us to change our tactics, though.
@Event311_Day3WrapUp_Subject=Damage Report
@Event311_Day3WrapUp=It appears the Core is not done with us. It was once again able to defeat our security measures and tamper with our replication procedures. Work is continuing to reverse the actions of the Core but unfortunately, more vehicles were lost.\n\nIt appears the Core's intrusions cease after a certain time of day, and we do not expect any further loss today.  Being deprived of the Mosquito has greatly hampered our rapid response ability.
@Event311_Day4WrapUp_Subject=Damage Report
@Event311_Day4WrapUp=Finally, it is over!\n\nOur engineers have deduced how the Core breached our central mainframe, and have strengthed our security to thwart further attacks.\n\nWe must now figure out how to undo the Core's damage. More information will follow as resolutions are made.\n\nAlthough we can celebrate ending the Core's intrusions, it wasn't without loss: we are no longer able to construct the Lightning, our strongest remaining assault vehicle, nor our assault ATVs.

@Event311_StartGame_Subject=Gather troops to the caverns!
@Event311_StartGame=Attention, empire.\n\nOur engineers have deduced how the Core breached our central mainframe, and have strengthened our security to thwart further attacks.  With this acheived, we must now focus on restoring our ability to construct vehicle matrices --as our enemies are no doubt doing.\n\nProducing new stockpiles of clean nanites will take a long time, during which time the empire could be at a military disadvantage. However, our engineers believe that with direct access to the AT computer systems in the caves, they can decipher the Core's modifications to our replications procedures, and quickly undo the modifications.\n\nIf successful, we may be able to regain our vehicles more quickly than the other empires. So gather troops and assemble in the caverns as soon as possible. We need to monopolize each and every base to gain advantage over the other empires!

@Event311_CavernClosed=\\#FFFF00%1 cavern has been closed.
@Event311_CavernOpened=\\#FFFF00%1 cavern has been opened.
@Event311_CavernLocked=\\#FFFF00%1 cavern has been locked by the %2.
@Event311_CavernLock_Subject=A victory in the caverns!
@Event311_CavernLock=Congratulations, soldiers!\n\nBy locking %1 cavern, you have significantly advanced our efforts to restore access to our entire arsenal of vehicles.\n\nSavor this victory, but don't relax - %2 cavern is now open and all of its bases have gone neutral.  The other empires are already attempting to lay claim to this new battlefield.  Don't let them.\n\nMove out!
@Event311_CavernLock_Enemy_Subject=Setback in the caverns
@Event311_CavernLock_Enemy=%1 cavern has been locked by the %2.\n\nEvery defeat, however, merely creates a new opportunity to prove your worth to the empire.  %3 cavern is now open and all of its bases are neutral, ready to be captured.  Assemble all available squads and platoons and head for the nearest active Geowarp.\n\nMove out!
@Event311_CavernRotate_Warning=\\#FFFF00%1 cavern will close in %2 minutes...
@Event311_CavernRotate_Subject=Caverns rotated
@Event311_CavernRotate=%1 cavern has closed and %2 cavern has opened with all of its bases neutralized.\n\nThis could be our opportunity to break the stalemate.  Head for %2 on the double!

@Event311_GameOver_Subject=Global vehicle replication systems restored to normal
@Event311_GameOver=Congratulations Soldier!\n\nYour actions in the Caverns have restored our vehicles, and the security of the Empire.\n\nAlthough it seemed for a time that the Core might permanently cripple our military capability, with the new security measures our engineers have devised you can feel secure that nothing like this will ever happen again...\n\n...but should another event like this occur, we have complete faith in your ability to handle the crisis.\n\nGood work, soldier.

Scientists and technicians used this backwater Lattice Node as the staging ground from which they would insert the strings of viral code that would isolate this tower from the rest of the lattice and create the necessary links from which it could propagate outward. \n\nIt took a team of thirty-seven people six months to insert the necessary backdoors and break the Republic encryption that protected the Lattice from this sort of activity.

@xp_monolith_cyssor_message=CYSSOR MONOLITH\n\nThe Dropship Center Gunuku was a test of humanity's capacity to extend the alien nanite construction network to construct large and complex objects like the Galaxy and Lodestar. The facility was placed on this island to keep it isolated from the humans who came to set up camps in Cyssor's temperate climate. An early experiment obliterated the Amp Station that once housed this research project here. Once the construction pathways were stabilized, Gunuku was opened up to General Personnel and the Dropship Center became a standard blueprint in the Terran Colonies.

@xp_monolith_forseral_message=FORSERAL MONOLITH\n\nThe first Orbital Strike was launched from this point a month after war broke out between the New Conglomerate and the Terran Republic. When the Terran Republic had overtaken Forseral and forced the NC into a last stand at this facility, they used the opportunity for a demonstration of the Empire's power. Within a week, the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty would have Orbital Strike capabilities of their own.

@xp_monolith_ceryshen_descrip=You are looking upon the Ceryshen Monolith
@xp_monolith_ceryshen_message=CERYSHEN MONOLITH\n\nThe Ceryshen Bridge was an early experiment in the use of Nanite construction technology. The valley that separated the two vistas was closed in less than a day by an elite team of military engineers. Less than a year later, this same corps of engineers would meet here again, fighting for different Empires in one of the most brutal battles of the early conflicts.
@xp_monolith_esamir_label=Monolith: Esamir
@xp_monolith_esamir_descrip=You are looking upon the Esamir Monolith
@xp_monolith_esamir_message=ESAMIR MONOLITH\n\nEsamir was the last continent to be mapped on Auraxis. The warpgate here has a history of instability and shifting destinations during the instances when it is active. However, it also carries the strongest matrixing echoes, and is the one where many of the Ancient weapon designs, such as the Lasher, were first constructed by residual warpgate patterns.
@xp_monolith_searhus_label=Monolith: Searhus
@xp_monolith_searhus_descrip=You are looking upon the Searhus Monolith
@xp_monolith_searhus_message=SEARHUS MONOLITH\n\nThis site was zoned for the construction of an emitter column, intended to transmit Warpgate energy through the wormhole in the hopes of extending the lattice network to other planets. Shortly before construction was to begin, the databanks that held the blueprints for this facility were lost in what appeared to be an act of sabotage. After that time, no communication had been received from the Republic on Earth until the transmission of BattleFrame schematics.
@xp_monolith_amerish_label=Monolith: Amerish
@xp_monolith_amerish_descrip=You are looking upon the Amerish Monolith
@xp_monolith_amerish_message=AMERISH MONOLITH\n\nAmerish was originally set aside as an Officers' Retreat, given its near perfect year-round weather conditions. Behind the Republic's back, the early leadership of both the New Conglomerate and the Vanu Sovereignty met frequently on this continent to plan their eventual secession from the establishment.

# BFR help strings
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@HelpBFR=BattleFrame Robotics

@HelpBFRText=BattleFrame Robotics (BFR's for short) are giant mechanical vehicles that move on legs, as opposed to wheels or treads. They are fully customizable and can be equipped with weaponry to fit a wide array of combat situations.\n\nThere are two configurations of the BFR, the two-man variant equipped with a gunner pack and the one-man variant equipped with a flight pack.\n\nThe Gunner Pack features a second seat for a gunner to man additional weaponry. From this position, the gunner can rotate a full 360-degree and has a high degree of up/down control for the largest field of fire possible. This is the basic BFR configuration.\n\nThe Flight Pack allows the BFR to perform a jet-assisted leap into the air. The flight BFR can maneuver left, forward, right, and back while in the air. BFR's equipped with a Flight Pack have lesser armor and shielding than the 2 man Gunner versions.  As such, the Flight versions rely on their speed and mobility and often act as fast attack vehicles.
 
@HelpBFRConfiguration=Acquiring and Configuring BFRs

@HelpBFRConfigurationText=BattleFrame Robotics are acquired from the BFR Hangar located in the courtyard of all continental facilities (but not in Battle Island courtyards). Once you have successfully imprinted and certified for a BFR, you may move to the terminal located on the side of the hangar to select the configuration you wish to purchase. Only BFR's that you are qualified to pilot will be displayed in the terminal menu.\n\nWhen you purchase a BFR from the Terminal's main menu, it will be fitted with a default weapon loadout. If you have saved BFR Favorite Configurations (see below), then you will be able to call one of those up directly from the Hangar.\n\nOnce you have acquired a BFR, you may configure it at the Rearm Silo located in all facility courtyards. When a pilot takes his or her BFR to the Rearm Silo, they will be instructed to press the action key ('G' by default) in order to access the purchasing menu and begin swapping out weapons and ammo in their loadout. Once you have created a BFR configuration, you may save it to your BFR favorites menu for quick access to it in the future.

@HelpBFRImprintingAndCertification=BFR Imprinting/Certification

@HelpBFRImprintingAndCertificationText=To qualify for BFR ownership, a soldier must first successfully create an authorized imprint with the Auraxian Core so that the identity core within the BFR will allow the human to integrate fully with itself. Without this integration, the player will be rejected by any BFR they try to board.\n\nTo create an authorization imprint, the player has to become recognized by the Auraxian Core by participating in energy exchanges within the caverns. These "energy exchanges" that the Core recognizes are facility ownership swaps and the destruction of other entities. A player must have participated in at least 5 cavern building captures (AT Plants, Redoubts, or Module Buildings) and overcome 75 enemies to be eligible for the imprint.\n\nIn order for a cavern capture to count toward imprinting, the cavern building must be significantly contested against enemy forces, with enough enemies engaged to make the capture reward meet or exceed 450 Battle or Command Experience Points. Soldiers must be within the cavern building's SOI at the time the building switches Empires for the capture to count toward the imprint.\n\nOnce the soldier is finished with the five cavern captures and 75 kills, they must enter the central energy beam of the Core Complex of any cavern to complete the imprinting process and become eligible for BFR certification.\n\nIn order to gain access to the advanced BFR flight variant, players must earn the Advanced BFR Commendation by using a BFR to kill 100 unique enemy soldiers and then killing another 7 uniques in a single life, for a total of at least 107 kills.\n\nA unique enemy is one that you have not killed in the previous twenty minutes and has been alive for at least 30 seconds. The streak of 7 enemies before being killed yourself must be completed after the first 100 (which do not have to be killed in a single life).

@HelpBFRVariants=BFR Variants

@HelpBFRVariantsText=Terran Republic: The TR Colossus is physically the largest of all BattleFrames. Resembling a walking tank, the Colossus is sure to provoke much fear in those that it encounters. Its flight variant is the Invader.\n\nNew Conglomerate: The Peregrine's size and mass is between the larger TR Colossus and the smaller VS Aphelion. It is also more of a hybrid looking BattleFrame in that it resembles a blend of the Colossus' walking tank look and the Aphelion's more humanoid shape. Its flight variant is the Eagle.\n\nVanu Sovereignty: The Aphelion is the smallest of the BattleFrames and the most humanoid in shape and proportion. Its flight variant is the Eclipse.

# Empire Benefits help strings
