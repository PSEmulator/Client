The layout of the Sanctuary map has changed significantly.  Three villas are located at different points on the map in
order to help spread players out.  Each villa is located near a continental warpgate.  Traveling between villas can be
accomplished either on foot or by vehicle, or through teleporters.  Refer to http://www.planetside.com/howto/manual_updates.jsp for detailed information on these revised Sanctuary maps.

A new "Lattice System" is used to show the relationship of all facilities on each continent.  The lattice is an integral
part of the facility capturing process, and important details on its use can be found at http://www.planetside.com/howto/manual_updates.jsp
