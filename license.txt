Recipient may not use, copy, modify, sell, auction, lease, rent, distribute, transfer or disclose any part of the Beta Software except as provided in this Agreement.  Recipient may only use the Beta Software for testing and evaluation purposes as set forth in Section 1.4 below.  All other rights are reserved to SOE.

	1.2	License Restrictions.  Recipient shall not:

		(a)	Sublicense to, transfer, distribute or permit use of the Beta Software by, any third party;

		(b)	Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Beta Software;

		(c)	Make copies of the Beta Software other than one (1) copy for back-up purposes to be used solely as a replacement for the original copy, provided that Recipient includes on the back-up copy all copyright and other notices that are included on the Beta Software; and

		(d)	Export the Beta Software in violation of the export control laws of the United States of America and other countries.

	1.3	Indemnification.  Recipient (a) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and (b) hereby releases, SOE and its direct and indirect parent, subsidiary and sister corporations, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and/or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) which result from, arise out of or in connection with the use of the Beta Software and all other services or activities related thereto.

	1.4	Testing and Evaluation Obligations.  Recipient hereby agrees to perform all of the following obligations: (a) to test, evaluate and analyze the Beta Software and its operation, features, capabilities and performance; (b) to comply with the reasonable requests of SOE from time to time regarding testing; and (c) to provide feedback and comments to SOE (including, but not limited to, bug reports and test results).  All of Recipient’s feedback and comments shall be the sole and exclusive property of SOE and/or its licensors or licensees, and SOE and/or its licensors or licensees shall have the perpetual right to use all or part of the Recipient's feedback or comments in any manner or media now known or hereafter devised.

	1.5	Personally Identifiable Information; Monitoring; Privacy Issues.  Recipient shall be required to provide to SOE, as a condition to participation in the Beta Program, certain personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, certain specifications of Recipient’s hardware and software ("Personal Information").  SOE’s retention and use of all Personal Information shall be subject to SOE’s posted privacy policy, as that policy may be modified by SOE in its discretion from time to time.  Recipient acknowledges that any and all Beta Software character data is stored and is resident on SOE’s servers, and any and all communications that he or she makes within the Beta Software (including, but not limited to, messages solely directed at another player or group of players) traverse through SOE’s servers, may or may not be monitored by SOE personnel and, accordingly, Recipient has no expectation of privacy in any such communication or in any communications referenced in Section 5.3 herein.	

	1.6 	Term of the Agreement.  Recipient’s participation in the Beta Program, and the grant of license herein, may be terminated by SOE at any time, for any reason or for no reason, in SOE’s sole and absolute discretion, by providing written or emailed notice to Recipient.  Recipient may, at any time and for any reason or for no reason, terminate his or her participation in the Beta Program by providing written or emailed notice to SOE.  The Beta Program will be terminated upon the earlier of (a) SOE’s written or emailed notice to Recipient or (b) the commercial release of the Game.  The termination of Recipient’s participation in the Beta Program and/or the termination of the Beta Program, however, shall not modify or supersede the survival provision in Section 6.1 below.      


2.	Reserved [Intentionally Left Blank].


3.	Ownership.  Except for the revocable, limited license expressly granted hereunder, SOE retains all rights, title and interests in and to the Beta Software and all copies thereof, and all game character data in connection therewith.  The Beta Software is copyrighted and is protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Recipient acknowledges that the Beta Software contains valuable trade secrets and/or other intellectual property of SOE, and that SOE and/or its licensors own all intellectual property rights in and to the Beta Software, including, without limitation, all patent rights, copyrights, inventions, trade secret rights, trade dress rights, trademark rights and intellectual property rights therein and thereto.  Recipient may not remove the copyright and other proprietary rights notices from the Beta Software.  Recipient agrees that this Agreement shall be retained with all printed and electronic copies of the Beta Software and documentation constituting the Beta Software.  Recipient agrees to prevent any unauthorized copying of the Beta Software.  Except for the revocable, limited license as expressly provided herein, SOE does not grant Recipient any express or implied right in any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information of SOE, and/or its licensors. In accordance with Section 1.4, Recipient agrees that SOE and/or its licensors or licensees own all rights, title, and interests in any and all of Recipient’s feedback and comments, without any remuneration, compensation or credit to Recipient.  To the extent that any of the rights assigned herein cannot presently be assigned under applicable law, Recipient agrees to assign such rights at such time as the rights are capable of being assigned.  Recipient agrees at SOE's request to execute such further documents and to do such further acts as may be necessary or desirable to document, perfect, register or enforce SOE’s and/or its licensor’s ownership of any of the rights, title and/or interests hereunder, in whole or in part including, without limitation, execution of a copyright assignment in a form provided by SOE in its sole discretion.  If Recipient fails or refuses to execute any such documents, Recipient hereby appoints SOE as Recipient’s attorney in fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, to act on Recipient’s behalf and to execute, deliver, record and file such documents. The rights granted, assigned and/or to be assigned by Recipient hereunder are granted for the entire universe and shall inure in perpetuity, and, as set forth above, no further consideration shall be payable to Recipient at anytime in connection therewith.  Recipient will acquire no right to use, and will not use without SOE's prior written consent, the names, characters, artwork, designs, tradenames, copyrighted materials, trademarks or service marks of SOE or its parent, related or subsidiary companies, employees, directors, officers, shareholders, assigns, successors, licensors or licensees: (a) in any advertising, publicity, marketing, promotion or on any website; or (b) in any manner other than in accordance with this Agreement.


4.	Injunctive Relief.  Recipient acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement would cause irreparable injury, that money damages would be an inadequate remedy and that SOE shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief, without the posting of any bond or other security, to restrain Recipient, from such breach or threatened breach.  Nothing in this Section 4 shall be construed as preventing SOE from pursuing any and all remedies available to it, including the recovery of money damages from Recipient.  


5.	No Warranty; No Liability For Damages; No Support; Character Data.

	5.1	No Warranty.  Recipient acknowledges that the Beta Software is a pre-release version and is not a final Game.  RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE BETA SOFTWARE MAY WELL CONTAIN ERRORS AND DEFECTS.  THE BETA SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	5.2  	No Liability For Damages.  IN NO EVENT SHALL SOE, ITS DIRECT AND INDIRECT PARENT, SISTER AND SUBSIDIARY CORPORATIONS, OR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS AND/OR DIRECTORS OF ANY OF THE ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE GAME, EVEN IF ANY OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no warranty is made that the Beta Software will generate programs with the characteristics or specifications desired by Recipient or that the Beta Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.  THESE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.	

	5.3	No Support.  SOE does not provide any support for the Beta Software.  However, SOE may provide an e-mail address and/or a passworded board for Recipient to send any questions and/or comments regarding the Beta Software.  SOE does not, however, make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy of any statements or advice provided in response to Recipient’s e-mail(s) and/or board postings.

	5.4	Test Environment.  Recipient acknowledges that the Beta Program is a test environment, that Game characters and/or character data will be frequently wiped or modified at SOE’s sole discretion, and that – notwithstanding any fee that Recipient may be charged for participation in the Beta Program – Beta Program Game characters and/or character data shall likely not be exported into the Game once the Game is commercially released. 


6.	Miscellaneous.

	6.1	Survival. The provisions of this Agreement, other than Sections 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3, 6.1 and 6.2  shall continue in full force and effect even after (i) the Beta Program has been terminated or completed and/or (ii) Recipient’s participation in the Beta Program has been terminated.

	6.2	Governing Law; Jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California excluding conflict of law rules and principles.

Recipient hereby waives any claim that such venue is improper or inconvenient.

	6.3	Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, and the validity and enforceability of all other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

	6.4	Entire Agreement/Changes in Terms.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral and written and all contemporaneous oral negotiations, commitments and understandings of the parties.  Changes made by Recipient to this Agreement will not be effective unless set forth in a writing describing the change and agreed to and signed by both SOE and Recipient.  SOE reserves the right to change the terms of this Agreement at any time upon notice to Recipient by e-mail.  Such changes by SOE shall be effective upon notice to Recipient and Recipient’s continued participation in the Beta Program after notice of a change in terms by SOE shall constitute Recipient’s acknowledgement of, and agreement to, be bound by such changes.
